Suppression of DHT formation by 5alphaR inhibition may be beneficial in early treatment or prevention of prostate cancer. Although 5alphaR2 is the dominant enzyme in the prostate, evidence indicates that 5alphaR1 may be up-regulated in some prostate cancers. This suggests that dual inhibition of both isoenzymes may be more effective than suppression of 5alphaR2 alone in prostate cancer treatment or prevention.

West of Scotland Lung Cancer Research Group, and the Aberdeen Oncology Group.","Abstract":"Proliferation of drug resistant tumour following chemotherapy is the principal cause of treatment failure in small cell lung cancer (SCLC). Verapamil has been shown to partially restore drug sensitivity in tumour cells rendered resistant in vitro. The results of the first large-scale randomised study of a resistance modifying drug given in conjunction with chemotherapy in cancer patients are reported. Two hundred and twenty-six patients have been entered. All patients received four cycles of cyclophosphamide (750 mg m-2), doxorubicin (40 mg m-2) and vincristine (1.4 mg m-2) on Day 1 and etoposide (75 mg m-2) on Days 1, 2 and 3, repeated at 21 day intervals. Those patients randomised to the verapamil arm received oral verapamil 120 mg qid for 5 days with each course of chemotherapy. Similar numbers of cycles of protocol treatment were given in both arms with over 75% of patients completing all four cycles. There were no significant differences in general toxicities between the two arms, except for more severe alopecia in the verapamil treatment group (P = 0.045). There was no significant difference in cardiovascular or haematological toxicity, although the median nadir white cell count after Cycle 1 chemotherapy was lower in the verapamil arm (P = 0.065) and there were significantly more dose reductions after Cycle 1 in the verapamil arm (P = 0.031). No statistically significant differences in response (P = 0.582) or survival (P = 0.290) data were seen. The absence of a significant improvement in response or survival using verapamil may relate to the low blood levels of verapamil seen in the clinic (0.8 microM), in contrast to those known to be maximally active in vitro (> 6 microM) or to the presence of other cellular mechanisms by which drug resistance develops.","Population":"small cell lung cancer.","Intervention":"verapamil","Outcome":"survival"},{"id":3,"PMID":"15304029","Title":"A randomized clinical trial of combination chemotherapy with and without low-molecular-weight heparin in small cell lung cancer.","Abstract":"BACKGROUND\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSmall cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a chemotherapy-responsive tumor type but most patients ultimately experience disease progression.

The 5-year cumulative incidence of relapse (\xb1 standard error) was 10.8 \xb1 0.7% in the dexamethasone and 15.6 \xb1 0.8% in the prednisone group (P < .0001), showing the largest effect on extramedullary relapses.

No difference was seen in 5-year overall survival (OS) in the total cohort (dexamethasone, 90.3 \xb1 0.7%; prednisone, 90.5 \xb1 0.7%).

In patients with precursor B-cell ALL and PGR, survival after relapse was found to be significantly worse if patients were previously assigned to the dexamethasone arm. We conclude that, for patients with PGR in the large subgroup of precursor B-cell ALL, dexamethasone especially reduced the incidence of better salvageable relapses, resulting in inferior survival after relapse.

Robust beneficial effects of cimetidine were noted: the 10-year survival rate of the cimetidine group was 84.6% whereas that of control group was 49.8% (P<0.0001). According to our previous observations that cimetidine blocked the expression of E-selectin on vascular endothelium and inhibited the adhesion of cancer cells to the endothelium, we have further stratified the patients according to the expression levels of sialyl Lewis antigens X (sL(x)) and A (sL(a)). We found that cimetidine treatment was particularly effective in patients whose tumour had higher sL(x) and sL(a) antigen levels. For example, the 10-year cumulative survival rate of the cimetidine group with higher CSLEX staining, recognizing sL(x), of tumours was 95.5%, whereas that of control group was 35.1% (P=0.0001).
