Vitamin C stimulates the production and activation of immune cells, so perhaps supplementation could be used to improve the immunity in those patients.

In only 4 trials randomization was used to determine if patients received vitamin C or a placebo. The result of this review does not prove that there is a clinically relevant positive effect of vitamin C supplementation in cancer patients in general on the overall survival, clinical status, quality of life (QOL) and performance status (PS), since the quality of the studies published is low. Interventions and patient groups are very diverse, hence an effect in some patient groups is possible. There seems to be a better effect with intravenous than oral administration. Nevertheless, treatment with vitamin C is safe with minimal side effects. Thereby, we think it is safe to examine the effects of vitamin C on specific groups of patients in a randomized controlled setting.","IncludeStatus":"Include","LisedInColA":"Yes","originalFormulation":"Yes","AloneOrComb":"Alone","cancerType":"Other","studyType":"Review: Meta-analysis","therapeuticAssociation":"Inconclusive"},{"id":"2","Drug":"Ascorbic Acid","PMID":"31096937","Title":"Phase I study of high-dose ascorbic acid with mFOLFOX6 or FOLFIRI in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer or gastric cancer","Authors":"Wang F, He MM, Wang ZX, Li S, Jin Y, Ren C, Shi SM, Bi BT, Chen SZ, Lv ZD, Hu JJ, Wang ZQ, Wang FH, Wang DS, Li YH, Xu RH.","Citation":"BMC Cancer. 2019 May 16;19(1):460. doi: 10.1186/s12885-019-5696-z.","CreatedDate":"5/18/19","Abstract":"Preclinical studies suggest synergistic effectiveness of ascorbic acid (AA, vitamin C) and cytotoxic agents in gastrointestinal malignancies.

Pharmacologic ascorbate (P-AscH<sup>-</sup>, i.e., intravenous infusions of ascorbic acid, vitamin C), but not oral ascorbate, produces high plasma concentrations capable of selective cytotoxicity to tumor cells. In doses achievable in humans, P-AscH<sup>-</sup> decreases the viability and proliferative capacity of pancreatic cancer via a hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>)-mediated mechanism. In this study, we demonstrate that P-AscH<sup>-</sup> radiosensitizes pancreatic cancer cells but inhibits radiation-induced damage to normal cells. Specifically, radiation-induced decreases in clonogenic survival and double-stranded DNA breaks in tumor cells, but not in normal cells, were enhanced by P-AscH<sup>-</sup>, while radiation-induced intestinal damage, collagen deposition, and oxidative stress were also reduced with P-AscH<sup>-</sup> in normal tissue. We also report on our first-in-human phase I trial that infused P-AscH<sup>-</sup> during the radiotherapy \\"beam on.\\" Specifically, treatment with P-AscH<sup>-</sup> increased median overall survival compared with our institutional average (21.7 vs. 12.7 months, <i>P</i> = 0.08) and the E4201 trial (21.7 vs. 11.1 months). Progression-free survival in P-AscH<sup>-</sup>-treated subjects was also greater than our institutional average (13.7 vs. 4.6 months, <i>P</i> < 0.05) and the E4201 trial (6.0 months). Results indicated that P-AscH<sup>-</sup> in combination with gemcitabine and radiotherapy for locally advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma is safe and well tolerated with suggestions of efficacy. Because of the potential effect size and minimal toxicity, our findings suggest that investigation of P-AscH<sup>-</sup> efficacy is warranted in a phase II clinical trial. SIGNIFICANCE: These findings demonstrate that pharmacologic ascorbate enhances pancreatic tumor cell radiation cytotoxicity in addition to offering potential protection from radiation damage in normal surrounding tissue, making it an optimal agent for improving treatment of locally advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma.","IncludeStatus":"Exclude","LisedInColA":"No Label","originalFormulation":"No Label","AloneOrComb":"No Label","cancerType":"No Label","studyType":"No Label","therapeuticAssociation":"No Label"},{"id":"4","Drug":"Ascorbic Acid","PMID":"15557412","Title":"The SU.VI.MAX Study: a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of the health effects of antioxidant vitamins and minerals","Authors":"Hercberg S, Galan P, Preziosi P, Bertrais S, Mennen L, Malvy D, Roussel AM, Favier A, Brian\u221a\xdfon S.","Citation":"Arch Intern Med. 2004 Nov 22;164(21):2335-42. doi: 10.1001/archinte.164.21.2335.","CreatedDate":"11/24/04","Abstract":"It has been suggested that a low dietary intake of antioxidant vitamins and minerals increases the incidence rate of cardiovascular disease and cancer. To date, however, the published results of randomized, placebo-controlled trials of supplements containing antioxidant nutrients have not provided clear evidence of a beneficial effect. We tested the efficacy of nutritional doses of supplementation with a combination of antioxidant vitamins and minerals in reducing the incidence of cancer and ischemic cardiovascular disease in the general population. The Supplementation en Vitamines et Mineraux Antioxydants (SU.VI.MAX) study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled primary prevention trial. A total of 13 017 French adults (7876 women aged 35-60 years and 5141 men aged 45-60 years) were included. All participants took a single daily capsule of a combination of 120 mg of ascorbic acid, 30 mg of vitamin E, 6 mg of beta carotene, 100 mug of selenium, and 20 mg of zinc, or a placebo. Median follow-up time was 7.5 years. No major differences were detected between the groups in total cancer incidence (267 [4.1%] for the study group vs 295 [4.5%] for the placebo group), ischemic cardiovascular disease incidence (134 [2.1%] vs 137[2.1%]), or all-cause mortality (76 [1.2%] vs 98 [1.5%]). However, a significant interaction between sex and group effects on cancer incidence was found (P = .004). Sex-stratified analysis showed a protective effect of antioxidants in men (relative risk, 0.69 [95% confidence interval [CI], 0.53-0.91]) but not in women (relative risk, 1.04 [95% CI, 0.85-1.29]).

After 7.5 years, low-dose antioxidant supplementation lowered total cancer incidence and all-cause mortality in men but not in women. Supplementation may be effective in men only because of their lower baseline status of certain antioxidants, especially of beta carotene.","IncludeStatus":"Exclude","LisedInColA":"No Label","originalFormulation":"No Label","AloneOrComb":"No Label","cancerType":"No Label","studyType":"No Label","therapeuticAssociation":"No Label"},{"id":"5","Drug":"Ascorbic Acid","PMID":"29438178","Title":"Treatment of pancreatic cancer with intravenous vitamin C: a case report","Authors":"Drisko JA, Serrano OK, Spruce LR, Chen Q, Levine M.","Citation":"Anticancer Drugs. 2018 Apr;29(4):373-379. doi: 10.1097/CAD.0000000000000603.","CreatedDate":"2/14/18","Abstract":"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) has a dismal prognosis and is often discovered at an advanced stage with few therapeutic options. Current conventional regimens for PDA are associated with significant morbidity, decreased quality of life, and a considerable financial burden. As a result, some patients turn to integrative medicine therapies as an alternate option after a diagnosis of PDA. Intravenous pharmacologic ascorbic acid (PAA) is one such treatment. The use of PAA has been passionately debated for many years, but more recent rigorous scientific research has shown that there are significant blood concentration differences when ascorbic acid is given parenterally when compared to oral dosing. This pharmacologic difference appears to be critical for its role in oncology. Here, we report the use of PAA in a patient with poorly differentiated stage IV PDA as an exclusive chemotherapeutic regimen. The patient survived nearly 4 years after diagnosis, with PAA as his sole treatment, and he achieved objective regression of his disease. He died from sepsis and organ failure from a bowel perforation event. This case illustrates the possibility of PAA to effectively control tumor progression and serve as an adjunct to standard of care PDA chemotherapy regimens. Our patient\'s experience with PAA should be taken into consideration, along with previous research in cell, animal, and clinical experiments to design future treatment trials.","IncludeStatus":"Include","LisedInColA":"Yes","originalFormulation":"Yes","AloneOrComb":"Alone","cancerType":"Pancreas","studyType":"Clinical case report","therapeuticAssociation":"Effective"},{"id":"6","Drug":"Ascorbic Acid","PMID":"1068480","Title":"Supplemental ascorbate in the supportive treatment of cancer: Prolongation of survival times in terminal human cancer","Authors":"Cameron E, Pauling L.","Citation":"Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1976 Oct;73(10):3685-9. doi: 10.1073/pnas.73.10.3685.","CreatedDate":"10/1/76","Abstract":"Ascorbic acid metabolism is associated with a number of mechanisms known to be involved in host resistance to malignant disease.

IVC dosing ranged from 1 g to more than 200 g ascorbic acid per infusion, typically administered 2 to 3 times weekly. IVC does not appear to increase toxicity or interfere with antitumor effects of gemcitabine/erlotinib therapy or paclitaxel and carboplatin. Based on 1 RCT and data from uncontrolled human trials, IVC may improve time to relapse and possibly enhance reductions in tumor mass and improve survival in combination with chemotherapy. IVC may improve quality of life, physical function, and toxicities associated with chemotherapy, including fatigue, nausea, insomnia, constipation, and depression. Case reports document several instances of tumor regression and long-term disease-free survival associated with use of IVC. There is limited high-quality clinical evidence on the safety and effectiveness of IVC. The existing evidence is preliminary and cannot be considered conclusive but is suggestive of a good safety profile and potentially important antitumor activity; however, more rigorous evidence is needed to conclusively demonstrate these effects.

These studies were criticized for their retrospective nature and lack of standardization of key prognostic factors including performance status. Subsequently, several well-designed randomized controlled trials failed to demonstrate a significant survival benefit, although these trials used high-dose oral vitamin C. Marked differences are now recognized in the pharmacokinetics of vitamin C with oral and IV administration, opening the issue of therapeutic efficacy to question. In vitro evidence suggests that vitamin C functions at low concentrations as an antioxidant but may have pro-oxidant activity at high concentrations. The mechanism of its pro-oxidant action is not fully understood, and both intra- and extracellular mechanisms that generate hydrogen peroxide have been proposed. It remains to be proven whether vitamin C-induced reactive oxygen species occur in vivo and, if so, whether this will translate to a clinical benefit. Current clinical evidence for a therapeutic effect of high-dose IV vitamin C is ambiguous, being based on case series. The interpretation and validation of these studies is hindered by limited correlation of plasma vitamin C concentrations with response. The methodology exists to determine if there is a role for high-dose IV vitamin C in the treatment of cancer, but the limited understanding of its pharmacodynamic properties makes this challenging. Currently, the use of high-dose IV vitamin C cannot be recommended outside of a clinical trial.

Based on epidemiological data, the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs is associated with a reduced risk of stomach cancer. Future studies should evaluate the role of other chemopreventive agents, particularly specific cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors, in reducing the risk of gastric cancer.","IncludeStatus":"Exclude","LisedInColA":"No Label","originalFormulation":"No Label","AloneOrComb":"No Label","cancerType":"No Label","studyType":"No Label","therapeuticAssociation":"No Label"},{"id":"16","Drug":"Ascorbic Acid","PMID":"29359968","Title":"In vitro effects of doxorubicin and tetrathiomolybdate on canine hemangiosarcoma cells","Authors":"Sloan CQ, Rodriguez CO Jr.","Citation":"Am J Vet Res. 2018 Feb;79(2):219-225. doi: 10.2460/ajvr.79.2.219.","CreatedDate":"1/24/18","Abstract":"OBJECTIVE To assess the in vitro effects of doxorubicin and tetrathiomolybdate (TM) on cells from a canine hemangiosarcoma cell line. SAMPLE Cultured cells from the canine hemangiosarcoma-derived cell line DEN-HSA. PROCEDURES Cells were treated with TM (0 to 1.5\u03bcM), doxorubicin (0 to 5\u03bcM), or both with or without 24 hours of pretreatment with ascorbic acid (750\u03bcM). Degree of cellular cytotoxicity was measured with a colorimetric assay. Long-term growth inhibition was assessed with a 10-day colony-formation assay. Induction of apoptosis was quantitated by fluorometric assessment of caspase-3 and -7 activation. Formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was also detected fluorometrically. RESULTS Exposure of cells to the combination of TM and doxorubicin resulted in a greater decrease in proliferation and clonogenic survival rates than exposure to each drug alone. This treatment combination increased ROS formation and apoptosis to a greater extent than did doxorubicin or TM alone. Ascorbic acid inhibited both TM-induced ROS formation and apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Results suggested that the enhancement in cytotoxic effects observed with DEN-HSA cell exposure to the combination of doxorubicin and TM was achieved through an increase in ROS production. These findings provide a rationale for a clinical trial of this treatment combination in dogs with hemangiosarcoma.","IncludeStatus":"Exclude","LisedInColA":"No Label","originalFormulation":"No Label","AloneOrComb":"No Label","cancerType":"No Label","studyType":"No Label","therapeuticAssociation":"No Label"},{"id":"17","Drug":"Ascorbic Acid","PMID":"16615097","Title":"Phase II study of mitoxantrone and ketoconazole for hormone-refractory prostate cancer","Authors":"Eklund J, Kozloff M, Vlamakis J, Starr A, Mariott M, Gallot L, Jovanovic B, Schilder L, Robin E, Pins M, Bergan RC.","Citation":"Cancer. 2006 Jun 1;106(11):2459-65. doi: 10.1002/cncr.21880.","CreatedDate":"4/15/06","Abstract":"Doxorubicin plus ketoconazole has exhibited significant activity in patients with advanced prostate cancer.

Six trials evaluated ATO as a single agent or in combination with ascorbic acid and ten trials added ATO to other cytostatic agents. Apart from one randomized controlled trial (RCT), all other studies were designed as case series. The patient numbers were generally small, treatment regimens differed both regarding the dosage of ATO and combinations with other drugs.

Overall response rates in combined regimens varied widely between 12% and 100%. Response rates for patients in the three arms of the RCT did not differ significantly. The results demonstrate the potential efficacy of ATO in refractory multiple myeloma, but the validity of these findings is reduced by considerable methodological flaws. RCTs should further investigate the efficacy of ATO or new arsenicals in order to overcome methodological concerns of the studies presented here.

Recent studies have demonstrated that high-dose, intravenous pharmacological ascorbate (ascorbic acid, vitamin C) induces cytotoxicity and oxidative stress selectively in pancreatic cancer cells vs. normal cells, suggesting a promising new role of ascorbate as a therapeutic agent. At physiologic concentrations, ascorbate functions as a reducing agent and antioxidant. However, when pharmacological ascorbate is given intravenously, it is possible to achieve millimolar plasma concentration. At these pharmacological levels, and in the presence of catalytic metal ions, ascorbate can induce oxidative stress through the generation of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Recent in vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated ascorbate oxidation occurs extracellularly, generating H2O2 flux into cells resulting in oxidative stress. Pharmacologic ascorbate also inhibits the growth of pancreatic tumor xenografts and displays synergistic cytotoxic effects when combined with gemcitabine in pancreatic cancer. Phase I trials of pharmacological ascorbate in pancreatic cancer patients have demonstrated safety and potential efficacy. In this chapter, we will review the mechanism of ascorbate-induced cytotoxicity, examine the use of pharmacological ascorbate in treatment and assess the current data supporting its potential as an adjuvant in pancreatic cancer.

We carried out a dose-finding phase I and pharmacokinetic study of i.v. ascorbic acid in patients with advanced malignancies. Patients with advanced cancer or hematologic malignancy were assigned to sequential cohorts infused with 0.4, 0.6, 0.9 and 1.5 g ascorbic acid/kg body weight three times weekly. Adverse events and toxicity were minimal at all dose levels. No patient had an objective anticancer response. High-dose i.v. ascorbic acid was well tolerated but failed to demonstrate anticancer activity when administered to patients with previously treated advanced malignancies. The promise of this approach may lie in combination with cytotoxic or other redox-active molecules.","IncludeStatus":"Include","LisedInColA":"Yes","originalFormulation":"Yes","AloneOrComb":"Alone","cancerType":"Other","studyType":"Clinical trial","therapeuticAssociation":"No effect"},{"id":"31","Drug":"Ascorbic Acid","PMID":"17686823","Title":"Chemoprevention of primary liver cancer: a randomized, double-blind trial in Linxian, China","Authors":"Qu CX, Kamangar F, Fan JH, Yu B, Sun XD, Taylor PR, Chen BE, Abnet CC, Qiao YL, Mark SD, Dawsey SM.","Citation":"J Natl Cancer Inst. 2007 Aug 15;99(16):1240-7. doi: 10.1093/jnci/djm084.

New primary prevention strategies are needed to reduce mortality from this disease. We examined the effects of supplementation with four different combinations of vitamins and minerals on primary liver cancer mortality among 29450 initially healthy adults from Linxian, China. Participants were randomly assigned to take either a vitamin-mineral combination (\\"factor\\") or a placebo daily for 5.25 years (March 1986-May 1991). Four factors (at doses one to two times the US Recommended Daily Allowance)-retinol and zinc (factor A); riboflavin and niacin (factor B); ascorbic acid and molybdenum (factor C); and beta-carotene, alpha-tocopherol, and selenium (factor D)-were tested in a partial factorial design. The study outcome was primary liver cancer death occurring from 1986 through 2001. Adjusted Cox proportional hazards models were used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of liver cancer death with and without each factor. All P values are two-sided. A total of 151 liver cancer deaths occurred during the analysis period. No statistically significant differences in liver cancer mortality were found comparing the presence and absence of any of the four intervention factors. However, both factor A and factor B reduced liver cancer mortality in individuals younger than 55 years at randomization (HR = 0.59, 95% CI = 0.34 to 1.00, and HR = 0.54, 95% CI = 0.31 to 0.93, respectively) but not in older individuals (HR = 1.06, 95% CI = 0.71 to 1.59, and HR = 1.12, 95% CI = 0.75 to 1.68, respectively). Factor C reduced liver cancer death, albeit with only borderline statistical significance in males (HR = 0.70, 95% CI = 0.47 to 1.02) but not in females (HR = 1.30, 95% CI = 0.72 to 2.37). Cumulative risks of liver cancer death were 6.0 per 1000 in the placebo arm, 5.4 per 1000 in the arms with two factors, and 2.4 per 1000 in the arm with all four factors. None of the factors tested reduced overall liver cancer mortality. However, three factors reduced liver cancer mortality in certain subgroups.","IncludeStatus":"Exclude","LisedInColA":"No Label","originalFormulation":"No Label","AloneOrComb":"No Label","cancerType":"No Label","studyType":"No Label","therapeuticAssociation":"No Label"},{"id":"32","Drug":"Ascorbic Acid","PMID":"19041063","Title":"Arsenic trioxide with ascorbic acid and high-dose melphalan: results of a phase II randomized trial","Authors":"Qazilbash MH, Saliba RM, Nieto Y, Parikh G, Pelosini M, Khan FB, Jones RB, Hosing C, Mendoza F, Weber DM, Wang M, Popat U, Alousi A, Anderlini P, Champlin RE, Giralt S.","Citation":"Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2008 Dec;14(12):1401-7. doi: 10.1016/j.bbmt.2008.09.019.","CreatedDate":"12/2/08","Abstract":"Arsenic trioxide (ATO) is synergistic with ascorbic acid (AA) and melphalan against myeloma both in vitro and in vivo.

One episode of grade 3 hematological toxicity (leukopenia) and no grade 3 nonhematological toxicities (in particular, cardiac) were observed. The coadministration of AA did not alter the pharmacokinetics of As(2)0(3), and elevated AA levels were associated with decreased intracellular GSH. Serial in vitro studies demonstrated continued sensitivity of patient myeloma cells to As(2)0(3) + AA.

However, surgical excision remains the treatment of choice for oral leukoplakia. The use of antioxidant supplements has shown some promise, but the predictability of success remains uncertain and long-term results are unavailable. Before the decision to use any antioxidant is made, it is critical to obtain a histopathologic diagnosis of the lesion. When dealing with a lesion diagnosed as hyperkeratosis, it may be appropriate to choose an antioxidant that may take some time for clinical improvement to occur. However, as the grade of epithelial dysplasia becomes more severe, consideration must be given to the possibility of malignant transformation during antioxidant treatment. We do not recommend the use of antioxidant supplements in the treatment of any carcinoma. The therapeutic use of antioxidant supplements outside of clinical trials conducted at academic medical centers should be done with considerable caution by practitioners in private practice. It should be emphasized that in these clinical trial patients were seen at frequent intervals to monitor their progress and to intervene if there was a noticeable deterioration in the clinical appearance of the lesion. In spite of the uncertainty with respect to antioxidant treatment, there are circumstances in which it should be considered. Recurrence after surgical excision when there is little reason to believe that a second surgical excision would be any more successful is an ideal candidate. Also, patients with widespread leukoplakia that involves a large area of the oral mucosa might be suitable for treatment with antioxidants, as well as patients who have extensive medical problems that make them surgical risks. The choice of which antioxidant(s) to use is complex because thus far there is no combination that is superior to the others. Beta-carotene with ascorbic acid or alpha-tocopherol is attractive because of a lack of side effects, but the range in reported values for lesion improvement has been broad and the clinical improvement typically takes several months. Clinical response with 13-cRA is faster but requires baseline and periodic serologic testing, as well as close monitoring for side effects. In those circumstances in which time is an important consideration, 13-cRA might be useful because clinical improvement can be evaluated within a matter of weeks as compared with beta-carotene. The group from M.D. Anderson Hospital has shown the value of an induction dose of 13-cRA that is followed by a lower maintenance dose. Unfortunately, the problem of recurrence after discontinuation of 13-cRA is quite common. One aspect that has not been evaluated is the combination of conventional surgical excision and the administration of postoperative antioxidants. This would have the obvious advantage of conventional treatment of surgery together with the possible protective effect of the antioxidants. Although this is an attractive hypothesis, we do not know of any studies that have proven this to be beneficial.","IncludeStatus":"Exclude","LisedInColA":"No Label","originalFormulation":"No Label","AloneOrComb":"No Label","cancerType":"No Label","studyType":"No Label","therapeuticAssociation":"No Label"},{"id":"49","Drug":"Ascorbic Acid","PMID":"22848768","Title":"Ascorbic acid has superior ex vivo antiproliferative, cell death-inducing and immunomodulatory effects over IFN-\u0152\xb1 in HTLV-1-associated myelopathy","Authors":"Moens B, Decanine D, Menezes SM, Khouri R, Silva-Santos G, Lopez G, Alvarez C, Talledo M, Gotuzzo E, de Almeida Kruschewsky R, Galv\u221a\xa3o-Castro B, Vandamme AM, Van Weyenbergh J.","Citation":"PLoS Negl Trop Dis. 2012;6(7):e1729. doi: 10.1371/journal.pntd.0001729.

However, there is a lack of in vivo and in vitro studies exploring and comparing the effects of high-dose AA and IFN-\u03b1 treatment in the context of HAM/TSP. Therefore, we performed the first comparative analysis of the ex vivo and in vitro molecular and cellular mechanisms of action of IFN-\u03b1 and high-dose AA in HAM/TSP. Through thymidine incorporation and quantification of Th1/Th2/Th17 cytokines, we demonstrate that high-dose AA displays differential and superior antiproliferative and immunomodulatory effects over IFN-\u03b1 in HAM/TSP PBMCs ex vivo. In addition, high-dose AA, but not IFN-\u03b1, induced cell death in both HAM/TSP PBMCs and HTLV-1-infected T-cell lines MT-2 and MT-4. Microarray data combined with pathway analysis of MT-2 cells revealed AA-induced regulation of genes associated with cell death, including miR-155. Since miR-155 has recently been demonstrated to up-regulate IFN-\u03b3, this microRNA might represent a novel therapeutic target in HAM/TSP, as recently demonstrated in multiple sclerosis, another neuroinflammatory disease. On the other hand, IFN-\u03b1 selectively up-regulated antiviral and immune-related genes. In comparison to IFN-\u03b1, high-dose AA treatment has superior ex vivo and in vitro cell death-inducing, antiproliferative and immunomodulatory anti-HTLV-1 effects.

Seventeen dogs with lymphoma and 10 healthy controls. Prospective, observational study. Measures of oxidative stress [malondialdehyde and total isoprostanes (isoP)] and antioxidants [alpha-tocopherol, gamma-tocopherol, oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC), and glutathione peroxidase (GSHPx)] were assessed in dogs with newly diagnosed lymphoma before treatment compared with healthy control dogs. The same parameters were measured in the dogs with lymphoma on week 7 of the chemotherapy protocol when all dogs were in remission. At baseline, dogs with lymphoma had significantly lower alpha-tocopherol (P <.001) and gamma-tocopherol (P= .003) but higher GSHPx (P= .05), ORAC (P= .001), and isoP (P < .001) compared with healthy controls. In the dogs with lymphoma, alpha-tocopherol concentrations were higher (P= .005) and ascorbic acid were lower (P= .04) after treatment. Results suggest that dogs with lymphoma have alterations in oxidant and antioxidant concentrations and that the status of some of these biomarkers normalize after remission.

Intervention at any of these steps can potentially prevent the development of cancer. Several randomized, controlled trials have investigated the effect of dietary interventions, including the addition of wheat bran fiber, on the development of adenomatous polyps. In a familial adenomatous polyposis trial, patients were treated with 4 g of ascorbic acid plus 400 mg of alpha-tocopherol per day alone or with a grain fiber supplement (22.5 g/day) over a 4-year period. On an actual-intake basis, the combined intervention inhibited the development of rectal polyps. However, the Toronto Polyp Prevention Trial found no significant differences in polyp recurrence rates between patients who were counseled to follow a low-fat, high-fiber diet and patients consuming a typical Western diet with placebo fiber. A 9-month study of patients with resected colon adenomas found that dietary wheat bran fiber significantly reduced total, primary, and secondary fecal bile acid concentrations and excretion rates. Such bile acid levels are thought to be related to the risk of developing cancer. The Australian Polyp Prevention Project reported that the combination of fat reduction and a supplement of wheat bran reduced the incidence of large colorectal adenomas. These latter results suggest that intervention with a low-fat wheat bran supplemented diet inhibits the transition from smaller to larger adenomas, which may be a critical step in determining which adenomas progress to malignancy.","IncludeStatus":"Exclude","LisedInColA":"No Label","originalFormulation":"No Label","AloneOrComb":"No Label","cancerType":"No Label","studyType":"No Label","therapeuticAssociation":"No Label"},{"id":"52","Drug":"Ascorbic Acid","PMID":"15811209","Title":"Use of arsenic trioxide in haematological malignancies: insight into the clinical development of a novel agent","Authors":"Amadori S, Fenaux P, Ludwig H, O\'dwyer M, Sanz M.","Citation":"Curr Med Res Opin. 2005 Mar;21(3):403-11. doi: 10.1185/030079904X20349.","CreatedDate":"4/7/05","Abstract":"Arsenic trioxide delivers high rates of complete clinical remission in patients with relapsed/refractory acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL), and is associated with high rates of molecular remission as indicated by PCR negativity for the PML-RARalpha gene. Mitochondria are considered to be the primary intracellular target of arsenic trioxide, and preclinical and mechanistic studies suggest that this agent may have broad applicability in haematological and other malignancies. Investigations of this agent are ongoing in a range of haematological malignancies, and studies in newly diagnosed APL, acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), multiple myeloma (MM) and chronic myelogenous leukaemia (CML) are reviewed here using published articles and presentations at international congresses to June 2004. Medline was used to source published preclinical and clinical data, and abstract databases and publications from relevant major international haematology/oncology congresses were searched to source updates of preclinical and clinical trial data. Accumulating data indicate that arsenic trioxide may be a useful addition to the therapeutic regimens that have been so successful in treating newly diagnosed APL, and investigations are ongoing to incorporate this agent into the first-line APL treatment paradigm. Preliminary data from clinical studies indicate that arsenic trioxide has clinical activity as a single agent in MDS and MM, and combination therapies are being investigated. In MM, the combination regimens under study incorporate ascorbic acid, which can enhance the efficacy of arsenic trioxide by reducing intracellular glutathione concentrations. In CML, arsenic trioxide is being investigated in combination with imatinib mesylate in patients who have failed initial imatinib treatment. In AML, although results with single-agent arsenic trioxide were not encouraging, treatment using arsenic trioxide in combination with ascorbic acid is a proposed strategy in elderly patients not able to withstand intensive chemotherapy. This versatile agent has a predictable and manageable safety profile and avoids many of the severe toxicities associated with conventional chemotherapies. Ongoing clinical studies will help to define the role of arsenic trioxide in the treatment of haematological malignancies.","IncludeStatus":"Exclude","LisedInColA":"No Label","originalFormulation":"No Label","AloneOrComb":"No Label","cancerType":"No Label","studyType":"No Label","therapeuticAssociation":"No Label"},{"id":"53","Drug":"Ascorbic Acid","PMID":"18392145","Title":"A 12 week, open label, phase I/IIa study using apatone for the treatment of prostate cancer patients who have failed standard therapy","Authors":"Tareen B, Summers JL, Jamison JM, Neal DR, McGuire K, Gerson L, Diokno A.","Citation":"Int J Med Sci. 2008 Mar 24;5(2):62-7. doi: 10.7150/ijms.5.62.","CreatedDate":"4/9/08","Abstract":"To evaluate the safety and efficacy of oral Apatone (Vitamin C and Vitamin K3) administration in the treatment of prostate cancer in patients who failed standard therapy.

RKS262 showed superior cytotoxicity (IC(50) = 6-25 \u03bcM) against six representative NB cell lines compared to its parent analog Nifurtimox (currently in phase 2). Pre-formulated RKS262 (150 mg/kg/daily) pellets administered orally, suppressed tumor growth (60%, p = 0.021) in NB xenograft mice within 28 days. RKS262-treated SMSKCNR cells showed TUNEL-positive DNA nicks and activation of ROS, MAPKs (SAPK/JNK), caspase-3, and p53, along with suppression of the IGF-1R/PI3K/PKC pathway and the Bcl2 family of proteins. RKS262 caused G(2)/M-phase arrest and suppressed cdc-2, cyclin B1, p21, and cyclin D1/D4 expression. N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC; 10 mM) pre-treatment rescued cell viability of RKS262 (23 \xb5M)-treated SMSKCNR cells, and pre-treatment with ascorbic acid (100 \u03bcM) and a MAPK inhibitor SB203580 (20 \u03bcM) reversed SAPK/JNK, caspase-3 activation, PARP-1 cleavage, and suppression of IGF-1R, PI3K, and PKC phosphorylation. Further, treatment with exogenous BDNF (50 nM) did not suppress SAPK/JNK or ROS activation due to RKS262. Rather, BDNF (50 nM), EGF (100 nM) and IGF-1 (100 nM) co-treatment with RKS262 induced a remarkable S-phase arrest rather than a G(2)/M phase arrest when RKS262 was used alone. In summary, RKS262 shows oral efficacy in NB xenograft animals, and induces apoptosis in vitro in SMSKCNR cells via cell cycle arrest, MAPK and ROS activation, and suppression of IGF-1R/PI3K/PKC and Bcl2 family proteins in a growth factor (BDNF/EGF/IGF-1)-independent fashion.","IncludeStatus":"Include","LisedInColA":"No","originalFormulation":"Don\'t know","AloneOrComb":"Alone","cancerType":"CNS/Brain","studyType":"Preclinical in-vivo","therapeuticAssociation":"Effective"},{"id":"59","Drug":"Ascorbic Acid","PMID":"28813744","Title":"Alkaptonuria: A Case Report With Diagnostic Challenge","Authors":"Gali VL, Kerkvliet AM, Kusmak JM, Elwood JK.","Citation":"S D Med. 2017 Aug;70(8):366-368.","CreatedDate":"8/17/17","Abstract":"Alkaptonuria is a rare autosomal recessive metabolic disorder caused by deficiency of homogentisic acid (HGA) oxidase, the only enzyme capable of catabolizing HGA. Deficiency of this enzyme leads to excess HGA which deposits in the connective tissue. We present a case of a 64-year-old woman who was referred to the dermatology clinic for a full body mole check and skin cancer screening. Clinically she had blue/gray pigmentation of the external ear and sclera. Also she had a domed papule on the left cheek with punctate gray pigmentation which was biopsied. Histopathological examination showed a benign dermal nevus and nonpolarizable, yellow-brown, irregular shaped fibers. Subsequent organic acid screen showed markedly elevated urinary HGA, diagnostic of alkaptonuria. On specific inquiry, the patient revealed she had a history of bilateral Achilles tendon rupture, black urine, arthritis, and external ear discoloration for many years. The pigmented material was then considered to be HGA deposition within the dermal collagen fibers. However, without the appropriate clinical data and confirmatory lab findings, the pigmented fragments on skin biopsy represent a diagnostic challenge. Measures like low protein diet and ascorbic acid supplementation will slow down the disease progression and potential complications later in life; however, there is no definitive treatment for the disease. We emphasize the prompt recognition of the clinical signs and symptoms as well as the importance of the microscopic findings.","IncludeStatus":"Exclude","LisedInColA":"No Label","originalFormulation":"No Label","AloneOrComb":"No Label","cancerType":"No Label","studyType":"No Label","therapeuticAssociation":"No Label"},{"id":"60","Drug":"Ascorbic Acid","PMID":"26264692","Title":"Cytotoxic effects of high concentrations of sodium ascorbate on human myeloid cell lines","Authors":"Mastrangelo D, Massai L, Lo Coco F, Noguera NI, Borgia L, Fioritoni G, Berardi A, Iacone A, Muscettola M, Pelosi E, Castelli G, Testa U, Di Pisa F, Grasso G.","Citation":"Ann Hematol. 2015 Nov;94(11):1807-16. doi: 10.1007/s00277-015-2464-2.

Very few data are available on the role of ASC in the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Ascorbate behaves as an antioxidant at low (physiologic), and as pro-oxidant at pharmacologic, concentrations, and this may account for the differences reported in different experimental settings, when human myeloid cell lines, such as HL60, were treated with ASC. Considering the myeloid origin of HL60 cells, and previous literature reports showing that some cell lines belonging to the myeloid lineage could be sensitive to the pro-apoptotic effects of high concentrations of ASC, we investigated in more details the effects of high doses (0.5 to 7\xa0mM) of ASC in vitro, on a variety of human myeloid cell lines including the following: HL60, U937, NB4, NB4-R4 (retinoic acid [RA]-resistant), NB4/AsR (ATO-resistant) acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL)-derived cell lines, and K562 as well as on normal CD34+ progenitors derived from human cord blood. Our results indicate that all analyzed cell lines including all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA)- and arsenic trioxide (ATO)-resistant ones are highly sensitive to the cytotoxic, pro-oxidant effects of high doses of ASC, with an average 50\xa0% lethal concentration (LC50) of 3\xa0mM, depending on cell type, ASC concentration, and time of exposure. Conversely, high doses of ASC neither did exert significant cytotoxic effects nor impaired the differentiation potential in cord blood (CB) CD34+ normal cells. Since plasma ASC concentrations within the millimolar (mM) range can be easily and safely reached by intravenous administration, we conclude that phase I/II clinical trials using high doses of ASC should be designed for patients with advanced/refractory AML and APL.

Aplidin-induced apoptosis was only partially blocked by the general caspase inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-VAD-fluoromethyl ketone and was also sensitive to AG1478 (an EGFR inhibitor), PP2 (an Src inhibitor), and SB203580 (an inhibitor of JNK and p38 MAPK) in MDA-MB-231 cells.

N-Acetylcysteine and PP2 also partially inhibited JNK and p38 MAPK activation. The intracellular level of GSH affected Aplidin action; pretreatment of cells with GSH or N-acetylcysteine inhibited, whereas GSH depletion caused, hyperinduction of EGFR, Src, JNK, and p38 MAPK.

Currently, the majority of cancer patients combine some form of complementary and alternative medicine with conventional therapies. Of these therapies, antioxidants, added to chemotherapy, are a frequent choice. For this preliminary report, two patients with advanced epithelial ovarian cancer were studied. One patient had Stage IIIC papillary serous adenocarcinoma, and the other had Stage IIIC mixed papillary serous and seromucinous adenocarcinoma. Both patients were optimally cytoreduced prior to first-line carboplatinum/paclitaxel chemotherapy. Patient 2 had a delay in initiation of chemotherapy secondary to co-morbid conditions and had evidence for progression of disease prior to institution of therapy. Patient 1 began oral high-dose antioxidant therapy during her first month of therapy. This consisted of oral vitamin C, vitamin E, beta-carotene, coenzyme Q-10 and a multivitamin/mineral complex. In addition to the oral antioxidant therapy, patient 1 added parenteral ascorbic acid at a total dose of 60 grams given twice weekly at the end of her chemotherapy and prior to consolidation paclitaxel chemotherapy. Patient 2 added oral antioxidants just prior to beginning chemotherapy, including vitamin C, beta-carotene, vitamin E, coenzyme Q-10 and a multivitamin/mineral complex. Patient 2 received six cycles of paclitaxel/carboplatinum chemotherapy and refused consolidation chemotherapy despite radiographic evidence of persistent disease. Instead, she elected to add intravenous ascorbic acid at 60 grams twice weekly. Both patients gave written consent for the use of their records in this report. Patient 1 had normalization of her CA-125 after the first cycle of chemotherapy and has remained normal, almost 3(1/2) years after diagnosis. CT scans of the abdomen and pelvis remain without evidence of recurrence. Patient 2 had normalization of her CA-125 after the first cycle of chemotherapy. After her first round of chemotherapy, the patient was noted to have residual disease in the pelvis. She declined further chemotherapy and added intravenous ascorbic acid. There is no evidence for recurrent disease by physical examination, and her CA-125 has remained normal three years after diagnosis. Antioxidants, when added adjunctively, to first-line chemotherapy, may improve the efficacy of chemotherapy and may prove to be safe. A review of four common antioxidants follows. Because of the positive results found in these two patients, a randomized controlled trial is now underway at the University of Kansas Medical Center evaluating safety and efficacy of antioxidants when added to chemotherapy in newly diagnosed ovarian cancer.","IncludeStatus":"Include","LisedInColA":"Yes","originalFormulation":"Yes","AloneOrComb":"Combination","cancerType":"Ovary/Fallopian Tube","studyType":"Clinical case report","therapeuticAssociation":"Effective"},{"id":"65","Drug":"Ascorbic Acid","PMID":"21664268","Title":"Vitamins C and E: beneficial effects from a mechanistic perspective","Authors":"Traber MG, Stevens JF.","Citation":"Free Radic Biol Med. 2011 Sep 1;51(5):1000-13. doi: 10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2011.05.017.

Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) is an essential cofactor for \u03b1-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases. Examples are prolyl hydroxylases, which play a role in the biosynthesis of collagen and in down-regulation of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1, a transcription factor that regulates many genes responsible for tumor growth, energy metabolism, and neutrophil function and apoptosis. Vitamin C-dependent inhibition of the HIF pathway may provide alternative or additional approaches for controlling tumor progression, infections, and inflammation. Vitamin E (\u03b1-tocopherol) functions as an essential lipid-soluble antioxidant, scavenging hydroperoxyl radicals in a lipid milieu. Human symptoms of vitamin E deficiency suggest that its antioxidant properties play a major role in protecting erythrocyte membranes and nervous tissues. As an antioxidant, vitamin C provides protection against oxidative stress-induced cellular damage by scavenging of reactive oxygen species, by vitamin E-dependent neutralization of lipid hydroperoxyl radicals, and by protecting proteins from alkylation by electrophilic lipid peroxidation products. These bioactivities bear relevance to inflammatory disorders. Vitamin C also plays a role in the function of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) by recycling the eNOS cofactor, tetrahydrobiopterin, which is relevant to arterial elasticity and blood pressure regulation. Evidence from plants supports a role for vitamin C in the formation of covalent adducts with electrophilic secondary metabolites. Mechanism-based effects of vitamin C and E supplementation on biomarkers and on clinical outcomes from randomized, placebo-controlled trials are emphasized in this review.","IncludeStatus":"Exclude","LisedInColA":"No Label","originalFormulation":"No Label","AloneOrComb":"No Label","cancerType":"No Label","studyType":"No Label","therapeuticAssociation":"No Label"},{"id":"66","Drug":"Ascorbic Acid","PMID":"7782031","Title":"Recombinant a2 interferon (a-IFN) with chemo-hormonal therapy in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)","Authors":"Kountouras J, Boura P, Karolides A, Zaharioudaki E, Tsapas G.","Citation":"Hepatogastroenterology. 1995 Feb;42(1):31-6.","CreatedDate":"2/1/95","Abstract":"Recent studies on HCC treatment reveal a tendency to use combined immuno-chemo-therapy.

Understanding the molecular basis underlying these diverse biological actions of BHA is thus of great importance. Here we demonstrate that BHA is capable of activating distinct mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 2 (ERK2), and c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1 (JNK1). Activation of ERK2 by BHA was rapid and transient, whereas the JNK1 activation was relatively delayed and persistent. A major metabolite of BHA, tert-butylhydroquinone (tBHQ), also activated ERK2 but weakly stimulated JNK1 activity. Furthermore, tBHQ activation of ERK2 was late and prolonged, showing a kinetics different from that induced by BHA. ERK2 activation by both compounds required the involvement of an upstream signaling kinase MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK), as evidenced by the inhibitory effect of a MEK inhibitor, PD98059. Pretreatment with N-acetyl-L-cysteine, glutathione, or vitamin E attenuated ERK2 but not JNK1 activation by BHA and tBHQ. Modulation of intracellular H2O2 levels by direct addition of catalase or pretreatment with a catalase inhibitor, aminotriazole, also affected BHA- and tBHQ-stimulated ERK2 activity but not JNK1, indicating the involvement of oxidative stress in the ERK2 activation by these two compounds. However, we did not observe any generation of H2O2 after exposure of cells to BHA or tBHQ using a H2O2-sensitive fluorescent probe, 2\',7\'-dichlorofluorescein diacetate. Instead, BHA and tBHQ substantially reduced the amount of intracellular H2O2. Furthermore, BHA and tBHQ activation of ERK2 was strongly inhibited by ascorbic acid and a peroxidase inhibitor, sodium azide, suggesting the potential role of phenoxyl radicals and/or their derivatives. Taken together, our results indicate that (i) BHA and its metabolite tBHQ differentially regulate MAPK pathways, and (ii) oxidative stress due to the generation of reactive intermediates, possibly phenoxyl radicals but not H2O2, is responsible for the ERK2 activation by BHA and tBHQ, whereas the JNK1 activation may require a distinct yet unknown mechanism.","IncludeStatus":"Exclude","LisedInColA":"No Label","originalFormulation":"No Label","AloneOrComb":"No Label","cancerType":"No Label","studyType":"No Label","therapeuticAssociation":"No Label"},{"id":"68","Drug":"Ascorbic Acid","PMID":"12648599","Title":"The use of antioxidant therapies during chemotherapy","Authors":"Drisko JA, Chapman J, Hunter VJ.","Citation":"Gynecol Oncol. 2003 Mar;88(3):434-9. doi: 10.1016/s0090-8258(02)00067-7.","CreatedDate":"3/22/03","Abstract":"At the present time, many cancer patients combine some form of complementary and alternative medicine therapies with their conventional therapies.

As early as 1978, investigators in Korea carried out extensive long-term anticarcinogenicity experiments using the mouse lung tumor model and observed an anticarcinogenic effect of Panax ginseng C.A. Meyer extract in 1980. The results showed that natural products can provide hope for human cancer prevention. A newly established nine-week medium-term model using mouse lung tumors (Yun\'s model) could confirm the anticarcinogenicity of ginseng that varies according to its type and age. Subsequently, the ginseng was shown by epidemiological studies to be a nonorgan-specific cancer preventive agent associated with a dose-response relationship. The anticarcinogenic effects of vegetarian foods common at every dining table in Korea and some synthetics were also studied using Yun\'s nine-week model. In brief, ascorbic acid, soybean lecithin, capsaicin, biochanin A, Ganoderma lucidum, caffeine, and a novel synthetic 2-(allylthio)pyrazine decrease the incidence of mouse lung tumors, whereas fresh ginseng (4 years old), carrot, spinach, Sesamum indicum, beta-carotene, and 13-cis retinoic acid do not. This result regarding beta-carotene is consistent with the ineffective findings of the ATBC trial, the CARET trial, and the Physicians\' Health Study. In 1983, a cancer chemoprevention study group was first established in Japan. Subsequently, (-)-epigallocatechin gallate, cryptoporic acid E, and sarcophytol A from natural products, and synthetic acyclic retinoid and canventol were shown to be anticarcinogenic or chemopreventive in human subjects. Despite the frequent consumption of tea wordwide as a beverage and current experimental evidence of anticarcinogenesis, including controversial results of epidemiological studies, more systematic clinical trials for confirmation of preventive activity of tea against cancer are needed. Placebo-controlled intervention trials of dietary fiber are under study in Japan. In the past decade, new triterpenoids were isolated from various natural sources, and its biological activities were investigated in Asia. In the late 1970s a comprehensive chemoprevention program was established at the Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences. Since then, many retinoid compounds have been synthesized and screened in the search for chemopreventive cancer agents. The National Cancer Institute (USA) and China are jointly engaged in the two-nutrition intervention in Linxian, China. The results of joint study of the general population and of dysplasia in China should stimulate further research to clarify the potential benefits of micronutrient supplements. We need to clarify if there is a connection between the lower rates of cancer mortality in Korea and the frequent consumption of anticarcinogenic vegetables or traditional foods, including ginseng and Ganoderma lucidum.

By using a low-dose solar-simulated radiation protocol, we investigated whether oral supplementation of the antioxidants RRR-alpha-tocopherol combined with L-ascorbic acid prevented radiation-induced suppression of the contact hypersensitivity response to nickel sulfate. In a prospective, randomized study, nickel-sensitive individuals were given RRR-alpha-tocopherol 2 g/d oral supplements combined with L-ascorbic acid 3 g/d for 50 d (group 1). Individuals in the control group were given a placebo (group 2). The reaction to a standardized patch test with serial dilutions of nickel sulfate and the irritant skin reaction to sodium lauryl sulfate were assessed by visual grading and by reflectance spectrophotometry in radiation-exposed and nonexposed skin 50 days after supplementation. Results showed that the contact hypersensitivity response to the recall antigen nickel sulfate was significantly suppressed in the radiation-exposed skin of those who took the placebo. Supplementation with RRR-alpha-tocopherol combined with L-ascorbic acid significantly protected against the radiation-induced suppression of the contact hypersensitivity response to nickel sulfate. The irritant reaction to sodium lauryl sulfate was not suppressed by radiation, and antioxidant supplementation did not modulate this response. In conclusion, a combination therapy of systemic high-dose RRR-alpha-tocopherol combined with L-ascorbic acid prevented solar-simulated radiation-induced suppression of the local immune response to the recall antigen nickel sulfate in human skin. This immunoprotective effect of combined RRR-alpha-tocopherol and L-ascorbic acid could be exploited for the prevention of solar radiation-induced skin cancer in an antioxidant intervention study.","IncludeStatus":"Exclude","LisedInColA":"No Label","originalFormulation":"No Label","AloneOrComb":"No Label","cancerType":"No Label","studyType":"No Label","therapeuticAssociation":"No Label"},{"id":"75","Drug":"Ascorbic Acid","PMID":"17602170","Title":"Impact of multiple genetic polymorphisms on effects of a 4-week blueberry juice intervention on ex vivo induced lymphocytic DNA damage in human volunteers","Authors":"Wilms LC, Boots AW, de Boer VC, Maas LM, Pachen DM, Gottschalk RW, Ketelslegers HB, Godschalk RW, Haenen GR, van Schooten FJ, Kleinjans JC.","Citation":"Carcinogenesis. 2007 Aug;28(8):1800-6. doi: 10.1093/carcin/bgm145.

We designed a human intervention study to assess antioxidative and possible anti-genotoxic properties of fruit-borne antioxidants. We hypothesized that individuals bearing genetic polymorphisms for genes related to quercetin metabolism, benzo[a]pyrene metabolism, oxidative stress and DNA repair differ in their response to DNA protective effects of increased antioxidant intake. In the present study, 168 healthy volunteers consumed a blueberry/apple juice that provided 97 mg quercetin and 16 mg ascorbic acid a day. After a 4-week intervention period, plasma concentrations of quercetin and ascorbic acid and trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) were significantly increased. Further, we found 20% protection (P < 0.01) against ex vivo H(2)O(2)-provoked oxidative DNA damage, measured by comet assay. However, the level of ex vivo induced benzo[a]pyrene-diol-epoxide (BPDE)-DNA adducts was 28% increased upon intervention (P < 0.01). Statistical analysis of 34 biologically relevant genetic polymorphisms revealed that six significantly influenced the outcome of the intervention. Lymphocytes from individuals bearing variant genotype for Cyp1B1 5 seemed to benefit more than wild-types from DNA damage-protecting effects upon intervention. Variants for COMT tended to benefit less or even experienced detrimental effects from intervention. With respect to GSTT1, the effect is ambiguous; variants respond better in terms of intervention-related increase in TEAC, but wild-types benefit more from its protecting effects against oxidative DNA damage. We conclude that genotyping for relevant polymorphisms enables selecting subgroups among the general population that benefit more of DNA damage-modulating effects of micronutrients.","IncludeStatus":"Exclude","LisedInColA":"No Label","originalFormulation":"No Label","AloneOrComb":"No Label","cancerType":"No Label","studyType":"No Label","therapeuticAssociation":"No Label"},{"id":"76","Drug":"Ascorbic Acid","PMID":"15670980","Title":"Chemotherapy alone vs. chemotherapy plus high dose multiple antioxidants in patients with advanced non small cell lung cancer","Authors":"Pathak AK, Bhutani M, Guleria R, Bal S, Mohan A, Mohanti BK, Sharma A, Pathak R, Bhardwaj NK, Prasad KN, Kochupillai V.","Citation":"J Am Coll Nutr. 2005 Feb;24(1):16-21. doi: 10.1080/07315724.2005.10719438.","CreatedDate":"1/27/05","Abstract":"In vitro and animal studies suggest that antitumor effect of chemotherapeutic agents may be enhanced by antioxidants.

Flavonoid glucosides (quercetin-3-glucoside and isorhamnetin-4-glucoside) were significantly elevated in plasma following ingestion of the onion meal and the increases were associated with an increased resistance of lymphocyte DNA to DNA strand breakage. A significant decrease in the level of urinary 8-hydroxy-2\'-deoxyguanosine was evident at 4 h following ingestion of the onion meal. After the combined tomato and onion meal, only quercetin was detected in plasma. Endogenous base oxidation was decreased but resistance to strand breakage was unchanged. There was no significant change in the excretion of urinary malondialdehyde following either meal. Both meals--onions, and onions together with tomatoes--led to transient decreases in biomarkers of oxidative stress, although the particular biomarkers affected differ.

This paper is concerned with the design of intervention studies to clarify which of these factors is important. The size of such intervention trials is influenced primarily by two factors: the incidence of the disease outcome studied in a control population and the magnitude of risk reduction in a treated group. Calculations based on a variety of assumptions suggest that a randomized trial in which cancer mortality is measured as the outcome of the intervention in a healthy population is probably too costly to be justified by current evidence linking the disease to diet. However, precursor lesions can be considered as an alternative outcome. The choice of the precursor lesion depends on the link to the disease in question, the prevalence of the lesion in the population, and the ease of detection. Recent developments in the application of endoscopic methods and in the description of the pathologic process leading to cancer suggest the use of gastrointestinal polyps as \\"precursor lesions\\" as the outcome of a trial.

The dog was treated with substantial surgical debulking of lesions, followed by daily topical 5% imiquimod cream applied to nonexcisable lesions, and received five doses of an experimental recombinant CPV2 L1 vaccine every 14 days for 10 weeks. At the end of the 10 weeks, two lesions remained and were excised. No additional treatment was needed and 10 months post-treatment the dog was lesion free. New therapies need to be developed and assessed, in controlled treatment trials, to determine the efficacy of single modality therapeutic interventions for severe, persistent canine cutaneous papillomatosis.","IncludeStatus":"Exclude","LisedInColA":"No Label","originalFormulation":"No Label","AloneOrComb":"No Label","cancerType":"No Label","studyType":"No Label","therapeuticAssociation":"No Label"},{"id":"89","Drug":"Azithromycin","PMID":"31488697","Title":"Mycoplasma pneumoniae Carriage With De Novo Macrolide-Resistance and Breakthrough Pneumonia","Authors":"Alishlash AS, Atkinson TP, Schlappi C, Leal SM Jr, Waites KB, Xiao L.","Citation":"Pediatrics. 2019 Oct;144(4):e20191642. doi: 10.1542/peds.2019-1642.

Five months later, the patient developed another <i>M pneumoniae</i> pneumonia that was diagnosed with positive macrolide-resistant <i>M pneumoniae</i> polymerase chain reaction and culture from the bronchoalveolar lavage. The child responded well to fluoroquinolones and eventually was discharged from the hospital. The <i>M pneumoniae</i> recovered from the second pneumonia is a novel strain and is genetically identical to the <i>M pneumoniae</i> that caused the first pneumonia, apart from the macrolide-resistance 23S ribosomal RNA gene. Both isolates are identical in both P1 (subtype 2 with a novel variant, 2bv) and multiple-locus variable number tandem repeat analysis type (53662). This is indicative of chronic <i>M pneumoniae</i> carriage with de novo macrolide-resistance mutation and subsequent breakthrough pneumonia that is reported for the first time here. Children with immunosuppression may be at increased risk of life-threatening macrolide-resistant pneumonia after <i>M pneumoniae</i> carriage. Further studies are required to evaluate the impact of this phenomenon. This will then guide strategies to limit the associated morbidity, such as testing for macrolide resistance, treatment of <i>M pneumoniae</i> pneumonia in high-risk children with bactericidal antibiotics (such as fluoroquinolones), and possibly eradication protocols of <i>M pneumoniae</i> carriage to prevent subsequent life-threatening infections.","IncludeStatus":"Exclude","LisedInColA":"No Label","originalFormulation":"No Label","AloneOrComb":"No Label","cancerType":"No Label","studyType":"No Label","therapeuticAssociation":"No Label"},{"id":"90","Drug":"Azithromycin","PMID":"31668569","Title":"The efficacy of mesenchymal stem cells in bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome after allogeneic HSCT: A multicenter prospective cohort study","Authors":"Chen S, Zhao K, Lin R, Wang S, Fan Z, Huang F, Chen X, Nie D, Du X, Guo Z, Lin D, Xuan L, Xu N, Sun J, Peng Xiang A, Liu Q.","Citation":"EBioMedicine. 2019 Nov;49:213-222. doi: 10.1016/j.ebiom.2019.09.039.

We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in BOS after allo-HSCT. This multicenter prospective cohort study enrolled 81 allo-HSCT recipients whose BOS were diagnosed within 6 months. The choice of prednisone and azithromycin combined with or without MSCs was based on patient preferences (MSC n\u202f=\u202f49, non-MSC n\u202f=\u202f32). The primary endpoint was response rate at 3 months, defined as the proportion of patients achieving FEV1 improvement or steroid sparing. The trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02543073). Response rate was 35/49 patients (71%, 95% CI 59 to 84%) and 14/32 (44%, 27 to 61%) in MSC and non-MSC group, respectively (p\u202f=\u202f0.013). The addition of MSCs was associated with a better difference for change in FEV1 rate of decline, compared to non-MSC group (53\u202fmL/months, 2 to 103; p\u202f=\u202f0.040). The 3-year overall survival post-diagnosis was 70.6% (55.9 to 85.3%) and 58.2% (36.1 to 78.5%) in MSC and non-MSC group, respectively (p\u202f=\u202f0.21). Clinical improvement was accompanied by a significant increase of interleukin (IL)-10-producing CD5+B cells. There was no statistical difference in the rates of infections and leukemia relapse between the two groups. MSCs were well-tolerated with no serious adverse events. MSCs offer an effective and safe therapeutic option for BOS after allo-HSCT. Our study strengthens evidence for clinical use of MSC therapy in BOS. These data also provide novel insight into potential biological mechanisms of MSC treatment and support further investigation in larger randomized controlled trials.

We reviewed the literature of the last 10 years to identify the best way to approach clean surgery. The question is more important for patients undergoing breast surgery. The presence of an infected breast wound delays the beginning of postoperative adjuvant anticancer therapy: there is good evidence to suggest that delayed adjuvant therapy compromises the outcome for patients in terms of both local control and survival. There are several clinical trials that have addressed the efficacy of prophylactic antibiotics for patients undergoing breast surgery and hernia repair. Platt et al assessed the efficacy of preoperative antibiotic prophylaxis in a clinical trial of 1218 patients undergoing clean surgery with an absolute reduction rate of 39% in wound infections. Gupta et al reported no influence on the incidence of infective complications by antibiotic prophylaxis in 357 patients undergoing elective breast surgery. Like breast surgery, use of prophylaxis in hernia repair is not clear: a prospective, randomized, double-blind, multicenter study of 619 patients assessed no benefit of antibiotic prophylaxis. On the other hand Lewis et al reported a 75% reduction of infections in low-risk patients when a single dose of cefotaxime was used in clean operations. A particularly interesting point is the use of prosthetic mesh in hernia repair and primary reconstructive surgery in breast surgery. Amland et al reported a significant reduction of the incidence of wound infections in a group of patients undergoing reconstructive breast surgery, receiving azithromycin vs placebo (5% vs 20%). In hernia repair we stress the need to prevent wound infections: currently Liechtestein\'s technique is widely performed all over the world. Mesh infection is an unpleasant event that requires prosthesis removal. The lack of conclusive studies about antibiotic prophylaxis in clean surgery suggests that a single-dose of cephalosporin at the induction of anesthesia may be prudent. This procedure is certainly inexpensive and safe and, more importantly, probably does not have an impact on antibiotic resistance.","IncludeStatus":"Exclude","LisedInColA":"No Label","originalFormulation":"No Label","AloneOrComb":"No Label","cancerType":"No Label","studyType":"No Label","therapeuticAssociation":"No Label"},{"id":"101","Drug":"Azithromycin","PMID":"24945651","Title":"Recurrent paraneoplastic wells syndrome in a patient with metastatic renal cell cancer","Authors":"Rajpara A, Liolios A, Fraga G, Blackmon J.","Citation":"Dermatol Online J. 2014 Jun 15;20(6):13030/qt35w8r1g3.","CreatedDate":"6/20/14","Abstract":"A 58-year-old man with a history of hyperlipidemia and hypertension presented to the dermatology clinic with a 3-month history of a sudden onset, progressively worsening pruritic eruption involving the torso and extremities.

She developed respiratory failure despite initiation of clindamycin and quinine, and required 12 weeks of azithromycin and atovaquone before blood smear and polymerase chain reaction findings were negative. Serologic evidence of B. microti infection was identified in 1 associated blood donor and 1 other recipient of that donor\'s blood. Babesia infection can be asymptomatic or cause mild to fulminant disease resulting in multiorgan failure or death. Patients with advanced age, asplenia, or other immune compromise are at risk for severe babesiosis and may require prolonged treatment to eradicate parasitemia. Incidence of transfusion-transmitted babesiosis has increased over the past decade.","IncludeStatus":"Exclude","LisedInColA":"No Label","originalFormulation":"No Label","AloneOrComb":"No Label","cancerType":"No Label","studyType":"No Label","therapeuticAssociation":"No Label"},{"id":"106","Drug":"Azithromycin","PMID":"15526516","Title":"Multiple myeloma in remission complicated by bone marrow granulomas","Authors":"Gologan R, Dobrea C, Popa L, Gioad\u0192\xc9 L, Dragomir M.","Citation":"Rom J Intern Med. 2003;41(3):323-8.","CreatedDate":"11/6/04","Abstract":"Granulomas are encountered in 1-2% of biopsies performed in various hematological and non-hematological diseases. Almost 50% of bone marrow granulomas are associated with infections and 25% with hematologic disorders, especially lymphoma and multiple myeloma. Toxoplasmosis is reported to induce granulomas in bone marrow inmunosuppressed patients. On the other side, long-term unexplained remissions after conventional treatment in multiple myeloma were mentioned in up to 10% of cases. A 56-years-old female patient was diagnosed with IgG(kappa) multiple myeloma in 1992. After 5 years, being still in complete remission, frequent bone marrow epithelioid non-caseating granulomas were noticed in biopsy, without clinical symptomatology or modifications of routine paraclinical examinations. The history revealed no treatments with antiarrhythmic, antihypertensive, anticonvulsivants or nonsteroid antiinflammatory drugs. The serologic tests for other infections or systemic diseases known to induce granulomas were negative, except those for toxoplasma gondii IgG. The treatment with azithromycine and pyrimethamine induced the disappearance of granulomas, simultaneously with an important decrease of anti-toxoplasma IgG antibodies titer. The bone marrow granulomas provide a valuable histologic clue to opportunistic infections and the bone marrow biopsy is useful for their diagnosis. In the specific case of toxoplasmosis, a recently proposed treatment with azithromycin induced the resolution of the granulomas. Due to the usual lack of specificity of the most bone marrow granulomas, a broad and long-term clinical, histopatological and serological follow-up to establish the etiology should be performed.","IncludeStatus":"Exclude","LisedInColA":"No Label","originalFormulation":"No Label","AloneOrComb":"No Label","cancerType":"No Label","studyType":"No Label","therapeuticAssociation":"No Label"},{"id":"107","Drug":"Azithromycin","PMID":"14575235","Title":"Neuropathological and ultrastructural features of amebic encephalitis caused by Sappinia diploidea","Authors":"Gelman BB, Popov V, Chaljub G, Nader R, Rauf SJ, Nauta HW, Visvesvara GS.","Citation":"J Neuropathol Exp Neurol. 2003 Oct;62(10):990-8. doi: 10.1093/jnen/62.10.990.","CreatedDate":"10/25/03","Abstract":"Here we present the neuropathological, ultrastructural, and radiological features of Sappinia diploidea, a newly recognized human pathogen.

Guidelines to recognize future cases of S. diploidea encephalitis are as follows. 1) It presented as a tumor-like cerebral mass without an abscess wall. 2) It had central necrotic and hemorrhagic inflammation that contained acute and chronic inflammatory cells without granulomas or eosinophils. 3) It contained trophozoites (40-70 microm diameter) that contained a distinctive double nucleus. 4) Cyst forms in the host were not excluded or definitely evident. 5) Trophozoites engulfed host blood cells and were stained brightly with Giemsa and periodic acid-Schiff. 6) Trophozoites often were present in viable brain parenchyma on the periphery of the mass without inflammatory response. 7) The prognosis after surgical excision and medical treatment was favorable in this instance.","IncludeStatus":"Exclude","LisedInColA":"No Label","originalFormulation":"No Label","AloneOrComb":"No Label","cancerType":"No Label","studyType":"No Label","therapeuticAssociation":"No Label"},{"id":"108","Drug":"Chloroquine","PMID":"29929491","Title":"Chloroquine reduces hypercoagulability in pancreatic cancer through inhibition of neutrophil extracellular traps","Authors":"Boone BA, Murthy P, Miller-Ocuin J, Doerfler WR, Ellis JT, Liang X, Ross MA, Wallace CT, Sperry JL, Lotze MT, Neal MD, Zeh HJ 3rd.","Citation":"BMC Cancer. 2018 Jun 22;18(1):678. doi: 10.1186/s12885-018-4584-2.","CreatedDate":"6/23/18","Abstract":"The hypercoagulable state associated with pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDA) results in increased risk of venous thromboembolism, leading to substantial morbidity and mortality. Recently, neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), whereby activated neutrophils release their intracellular contents containing DNA, histones, tissue factor, high mobility group box\xa01 (HMGB1) and other components have been implicated in PDA and in cancer-associated thrombosis. Utilizing an orthotopic murine PDA model in C57/Bl6 mice and patient correlative samples, we studied the role of NETs in PDA hypercoagulability and targeted this pathway through treatment with the NET inhibitor chloroquine. PAD4 and RAGE knockout mice, deficient in NET formation, were used to study the role of NETs in platelet aggregation, release of tissue factor and hypercoagulability. Platelet aggregation was assessed using collagen-activated impedance aggregometry. Levels of circulating tissue factor, the initiator of extrinsic coagulation, were measured using ELISA. Thromboelastograms (TEGs) were performed to assess hypercoagulability and changes associated with treatment. Correlative data and samples from a randomized clinical trial of preoperative gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel with and without hydroxychloroquine were studied and the impact of treatment on venous thromboembolism (VTE) rate was evaluated. The addition of NETs to whole blood stimulated platelet activation and aggregation. DNA and the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) were necessary for induction of NET associated platelet aggregation. PAD4 knockout tumor-burdened mice, unable to form NETs, had decreased aggregation and decreased circulating tissue factor. The NET inhibitor chloroquine reduces platelet aggregation, reduces circulating tissue factor and decreases hypercoagulability on TEG. Review of correlative data from patients treated on a randomized protocol of preoperative chemotherapy with and without hydroxychloroquine demonstrated a reduction in peri-operative VTE rate from 30 to 9.1% with hydroxychloroquine that neared statistical significance (p\u2009=\u20090.053) despite the trial not being designed to study VTE. NETs promote hypercoagulability in murine PDA through stimulation of platelets and release of tissue factor. Chloroquine inhibits NETs and diminishes hypercoagulability. These findings support clinical study of chloroquine to lower rates of venous thromboembolism in patients with cancer.

Enhanced brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed a solid cystic lesion in the right partial space suggesting GBM. Serum testing revealed vitamin D deficiency and elevated levels of insulin and triglycerides. Prior to subtotal tumor resection and standard of care (SOC), the patient conducted a 72-h water-only fast. Following the fast, the patient initiated a vitamin/mineral-supplemented ketogenic diet (KD) for 21\u2009days that delivered 900\u2009kcal/day. In addition to radiotherapy, temozolomide chemotherapy, and the KD (increased to 1,500\u2009kcal/day at day 22), the patient received metformin (1,000\u2009mg/day), methylfolate (1,000\u2009mg/day), chloroquine phosphate (150\u2009mg/day), epigallocatechin gallate (400\u2009mg/day), and hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) (60\u2009min/session, 5 sessions/week at 2.5 ATA). The patient also received levetiracetam (1,500\u2009mg/day). No steroid medication was given at any time. Post-surgical histology confirmed the diagnosis of GBM. Reduced invasion of tumor cells and thick-walled hyalinized blood vessels were also seen suggesting a therapeutic benefit of pre-surgical metabolic therapy. After 9\u2009months treatment with the modified SOC and complimentary ketogenic metabolic therapy (KMT), the patient\'s body weight was reduced by about 19%. Seizures and left limb weakness resolved. Biomarkers showed reduced blood glucose and elevated levels of urinary ketones with evidence of reduced metabolic activity (choline/N-acetylaspartate ratio) and normalized levels of insulin, triglycerides, and vitamin D. This is the first report of confirmed GBM treated with a modified SOC together with KMT and HBOT, and other targeted metabolic therapies. As rapid regression of GBM is rare following subtotal resection and SOC alone, it is possible that the response observed in this case resulted in part from the modified SOC and other novel treatments. Additional studies are needed to validate the efficacy of KMT administered with alternative approaches that selectively increase oxidative stress in tumor cells while restricting their access to glucose and glutamine.

Here we report that co-deletion of Pten and p53 in murine prostate epithelium, often observed in human CRPC, leads to AR-independent CRPC and thus confers de novo resistance to second generation androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) in multiple independent yet complementary preclinical mouse models. In contrast, mechanism-driven co-targeting hexokinase 2 (HK2)-mediated Warburg effect with 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) and ULK1-dependent autophagy with chloroquine (CQ) selectively kills cancer cells through intrinsic apoptosis to cause tumor regression in xenograft, leads to a near-complete tumor suppression and remarkably extends survival in Pten-/p53-deficiency-driven CRPC mouse model. Mechanistically, 2-DG causes AMPK phosphorylation, which in turn inhibits mTORC1-S6K1 translation signaling to preferentially block anti-apoptotic protein MCL-l synthesis to prime mitochondria-dependent apoptosis while simultaneously activates ULK1-driven autophagy for cell survival to counteract the apoptotic action of anti-Warburg effect. Accordingly, inhibition of autophagy with CQ sensitizes cancer cells to apoptosis upon 2-DG challenge. Given that 2-DG is recommended for phase II clinical trials for prostate cancer and CQ has been clinically used as an anti-malaria drug for many decades, the preclinical results from our proof-of-principle studies in vivo are imminently translatable to clinical trials to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy by the combination modality for a subset of currently incurable CRPC harboring PTEN and TP53 mutations.

However, patients ineluctably relapse with a delay varying from a few months to a few years. To improve reactivity prior to relapse it is essential to identify the mechanisms leading to such variability. We showed previously that sunitinib became sequestered in lysosomes because of its basic pKa. <b>Methods</b>: Modifications to gene expression in response to sunitinib and in sunitinib resistant cells were analyzed by transcriptomic and proteomic analysis. ROS production was evaluated by FACS. Nuclear Factor kappa B (NFkB)-dependent transcriptional regulation of inflammatory gene expression was evaluated with a reporter gene. Correlation of CXCL5 with survival was analyzed with an online available data base (TCGA) and using a cohort of patients enrolled in the SUVEGIL clinical trial (NCT00943839). <b>Results</b>: We now show that sunitinib sequestration in lysosomes induced an incomplete autophagic process leading to activation of the NFkB inflammatory pathway. We defined a subset of inflammatory cytokines that were up-regulated by the drug either after an acute or chronic stimulus. One of the most up-regulated genes in sunitinib-resistant cells was the CXCL5 cytokine. CXCL5 was also induced in RCC by chloroquine and in a model of HER2 positive breast cancer cell lines after acute or chronic treatment with lapatinib. CXCL5 correlated to shorter survival in RCC and to the most aggressive forms of breast cancers. The levels of CXCL5 present in the plasma of patients treated with sunitinib were predictive of the efficacy of sunitinib but not of the VEGF-directed antibody bevacizumab. <b>Conclusion</b>: This translational study identified CXCL5 as a biomarker of efficacy of lysosomotropic drugs, a potential asset for personalized medicine.","IncludeStatus":"Exclude","LisedInColA":"No Label","originalFormulation":"No Label","AloneOrComb":"No Label","cancerType":"No Label","studyType":"No Label","therapeuticAssociation":"No Label"},{"id":"112","Drug":"Chloroquine","PMID":"31870123","Title":"Exosomes as a Surrogate Marker for Autophagy in Peripheral Blood, Correlative Data from Phase I Study of Chloroquine in Combination with Carboplatin/Gemcitabine in Advanced Solid Tumors","Authors":"Abdel Karim N, Gaber O, Eldessouki I, Bahassi EM, Morris J.","Citation":"Asian Pac J Cancer Prev. 2019 Dec 1;20(12):3789-3796. doi: 10.31557/APJCP.2019.20.12.3789.","CreatedDate":"12/25/19","Abstract":"Autophagy is a catabolic process, utilized constitutionally by body cells to recycle nutrients and to remove unwanted/damaged intracellular constituents. It is enhanced during periods of stress, such as starvation and hypoxia, aiding in cell survival and it is linked to major cellular processes, such as apoptosis and antigen expression. The process has been extensively studied in vitro models or tumor tissue samples with rare application on human subjects. Plasma samples from 24 advanced solid tumor patients were collected at different time points before and after chemotherapy. Their exosomes were isolate and blotted for microtubule-associated protein-1 light chain-3 (LC-3B) protein as a marker for autophagy. All the subjects received a standard chemotherapy regimen of carboplatin- gemcitabine with chloroquine (CQ)/ hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) in chronic doses throughout their treatment period as an autophagy modulator. CQ/HCQ was given in 50 mg increments as guided by their tolerability to treatment. A total of 267 plasma samples were obtained for the 24 patients and processed. Each sample corresponds to a single time point. The first group included 6 patients, all received 50 mg of CQ with chemotherapy. LC-3B I was detected in their isolated exosomes, while LC3-BII was not detected in their samples. The second cohort of patients included 3 subjects who re-ceived 100mg of HCQ. They demonstrated both LC3-BI and II on day 15 after chemotherapy in one patient, and on third cycle after 24 hours in the second patient.

We now report that Unfolded Protein Response (UPR), autophagy, and apoptosis related genes cluster separately during lactation and involution in the mouse mammary gland. Time-course experiments in rodents show that autophagy and UPR signaling are tightly co-regulated at the transition from reversible to irreversible involution. Inhibition of autophagy by chloroquine or genetic deletion of one ATG7 allele enhanced progression of mammary involution into the irreversible phase, as characterized by an early/precocious induction of apoptosis. These are the first preclinical in vivo data in support of a clinical trial testing an autophagy inhibitor for prevention of intraductal breast malignancy progression to invasive breast cancer. In marked contrast, stimulation of autophagy by low dose tunicamycin treatment reduced apoptosis and extended the reversible phase of involution by sustaining the secretory epithelium. Autophagy stimulators could be used short-term to promote lactation in women experiencing difficulties or irregularities in nursing.

A 59-year-old male patient presented with a one-month history of itchy, polycyclic, annular, and partially serpiginous lesions involving the back, the gluteal region, and the extremities (Figure 1, a, b). There was no medical history of drug intake. High potency local steroids and antihistamines were prescribed, but without adequate therapeutic results. Extensive laboratory work-up including serological infectious disease testing was performed and was within normal ranges. Histopathological examination of a biopsy taken from a lesion on the gluteus showed perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate around superficial and deep vascular plexus with admixture of eosinophils that was found interstitially (Figure 2, a,b) and within the lobules of subcutaneous fat. The overlying epidermis was unremarkable. There were no signs of flame figures and granulomatous inflammation. Based on the clinical and histopathological findings, a diagnosis of EAE was established. The patient was given 40 mg of prednisone orally which resulted in partial improvement, but the lesions relapsed soon after the dose was tapered down to 20 mg. Chloroquine was started at a dose of 4 mg/kg daily for 10 days, then 250 mg daily for next the 10 weeks, resulting in complete clearance of all the lesions, which was sustained for over 2 years of follow-up. It is still matter of debate whether EAE is a clinical subtype of Wells syndrome (WS) presenting with an annular or figurate pattern or is a distinct entity. In recently published paper, El-Khalawany et al. argued that EAE is a peculiar clinical variant of WS, because flames figures, blood and tissue eosinophilia, and granulomatous infiltrate can be observed in well-developed and long-standing lesions (1). The etiology of EAE is still unknown, although it has been suggested that it occurs as a result of a hypersensitivity reaction to an unidentified allergen (2). EAE has been associated with Helicobacter pylori, Borrelia burgdorferi, and hepatitis C virus infection, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, thymoma, autoimmune pancreatitis, autoimmune hypothyroidism, and internal malignances (clear cell renal carcinoma, metastatic prostate adenocarcinoma) (3,4). Clinically, EAE is characterized by asymptomatic or mildly pruritic urticarial papules and plaques in annular configuration, mainly on the trunk and proximal extremities (5). Histologically, as in our patient, EAE is characterized by the appearance of a superficial and deep perivascular inflammatory infiltrate composed of lymphocytes and abundant eosinophils and absence of epidermal change (5). There is no standard treatment for EAE. Systemic steroids and antimalarials are the usual first-line options (5). Other treatment options include dapsone, indomethacin, cyclosporine, and UVB therapy (1,3,5). Response to antimalarials is usually observed within the first 2-4 weeks (2). However, as in our case, it may take several weeks for patients to respond to antimalarial treatment, and complete regression may even take longer (3). We believe that EAE should be treated with antimalarials over a longer time period in order to avoid frequent relapses.","IncludeStatus":"Exclude","LisedInColA":"No Label","originalFormulation":"No Label","AloneOrComb":"No Label","cancerType":"No Label","studyType":"No Label","therapeuticAssociation":"No Label"},{"id":"116","Drug":"Chloroquine","PMID":"28076793","Title":"Chloroquine-Inducible Par-4 Secretion Is Essential for Tumor Cell Apoptosis and Inhibition of Metastasis","Authors":"Burikhanov R, Hebbar N, Noothi SK, Shukla N, Sledziona J, Araujo N, Kudrimoti M, Wang QJ, Watt DS, Welch DR, Maranchie J, Harada A, Rangnekar VM.","Citation":"Cell Rep. 2017 Jan 10;18(2):508-519. doi: 10.1016/j.celrep.2016.12.051.","CreatedDate":"1/12/17","Abstract":"The induction of tumor suppressor proteins capable of cancer cell apoptosis represents an attractive option for the re-purposing of existing drugs.

Cytotoxic T-cells (CTLs) and Natural Killer (NK) cells are required to generate an effective immune response against viruses, functional exhaustion of which enables disease progression. Patients with severe COVID-19 present significantly lower lymphocyte, and higher neutrophil, counts in blood. Specifically, CD8<sup>+</sup> lymphocytes and NK cells were significantly reduced in cases of severe infection compared to patients with mild infection and healthy individuals. The NK group 2 member A (NKG2A) receptor transduces inhibitory signalling, suppressing NK cytokine secretion and cytotoxicity. Overexpression of NKG2A has been observed on CD8<sup>+</sup> and NK cells of COVID-19 infected patients compared to healthy controls, while NKG2A overexpression also functionally exhausts CD8<sup>+</sup> cells and NK cells, resulting in a severely compromised innate immune response. Blocking NKG2A on CD8<sup>+</sup> cells and NK cells in cancers modulated tumor growth, restoring CD8<sup>+</sup> T and NK cell function. A recently proposed mechanism via which SARS-CoV-2 overrides innate immune response of the host is by over-expressing NKG2A on CD<sup>+</sup> T and NK cells, culminating in functional exhaustion of the immune response against the viral pathogen. Monalizumab is an inhibiting antibody against NKG2A which can restore the function of CD8\xa0+\xa0T and NK cells in cancers, successfully ceasing tumor progression with no significant side effects in Phase 2 clinical trials. We hypothesize that patients with severe COVID-19 have a severely compromised innate immune response and could be treated via the use of Monalizumab, interferon \u03b1, chloroquine, and other antiviral agents.","IncludeStatus":"Exclude","LisedInColA":"No Label","originalFormulation":"No Label","AloneOrComb":"No Label","cancerType":"No Label","studyType":"No Label","therapeuticAssociation":"No Label"},{"id":"118","Drug":"Chloroquine","PMID":"31925317","Title":"A randomised phase II trial of hydroxychloroquine and imatinib versus imatinib alone for patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia in major cytogenetic response with residual disease","Authors":"Horne GA, Stobo J, Kelly C, Mukhopadhyay A, Latif AL, Dixon-Hughes J, McMahon L, Cony-Makhoul P, Byrne J, Smith G, Koschmieder S, Br\u221a\xfammendorf TH, Schafhausen P, Gallipoli P, Thomson F, Cong W, Clark RE, Milojkovic D, Helgason GV, Foroni L, Nicolini FE, Holyoake TL, Copland M.","Citation":"Leukemia. 2020 Jan 10:1-12. doi: 10.1038/s41375-019-0700-9.

Dysregulation of autophagy cellular death is common among a wide range of cancers and presents challenges to current treatment options. This review will evaluate current methods to directly and indirectly modulate autophagy to prevent cancer and to overcome resistance to anticancer therapy. PubMed was searched for keywords: autophagy, hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, and cell death for preclinical and clinical studies evaluating autophagy-modulating pathways and compounds. Clinicaltrials.gov was searched for keywords: autophagy, hydroxychloroquine, and chloroquine for clinical trials involving autophagy. The pathways of autophagy are highly prevalent in numerous cancers cell types including leukemia, renal cell cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, melanoma, and advanced solid tumor. Autophagy-inducing compounds represent various drug classes and include everolimus, bortezomib, vorinostat, and arsenic trioxide. The autophagy-inhibiting compounds include chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, and bafilomycin. Clinicaltrials.gov search identified 32 currently ongoing clinical studies evaluating autophagy and included 14 and 3 studies involving hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine, respectively. These phase I and phase II studies, evaluating the therapeutic benefit of combining autophagy modulators with current anticancer treatments, demonstrate early evidence for application in resistant cancer therapy. Despite positive results, there remains a need to identify direct-acting autophagy inhibitors and for larger phase III trials to be conducted. The preclinical evidence for modulating autophagy describes a promising, novel mechanism for enhancing anticancer treatments and overcoming current challenges such as chemotherapy resistance.","IncludeStatus":"Exclude","LisedInColA":"No Label","originalFormulation":"No Label","AloneOrComb":"No Label","cancerType":"No Label","studyType":"No Label","therapeuticAssociation":"No Label"},{"id":"121","Drug":"Chloroquine","PMID":"25866016","Title":"Antagonistic effects of chloroquine on autophagy occurrence potentiate the anticancer effects of everolimus on renal cancer cells","Authors":"Grimaldi A, Santini D, Zappavigna S, Lombardi A, Misso G, Boccellino M, Desiderio V, Vitiello PP, Di Lorenzo G, Zoccoli A, Pantano F, Caraglia M.","Citation":"Cancer Biol Ther. 2015;16(4):567-79. doi: 10.1080/15384047.2015.1018494.

Currently, new biologic drugs are used among which everolimus, an mTOR inhibitor, that has been approved for second-line therapy. Since mTOR is involved in the control of autophagy, its antitumor capacity is often limited. In this view, chloroquine, a 4-alkylamino substituted quinoline family member, is an autophagy inhibitor that blocks the fusion of autophagosomes and lysosomes. In the present study, we evaluated the effects of everolimus alone or in combination with chloroquine on renal cancer cell viability and verified possible synergism. Our results demonstrate that renal cancer cells are differently sensitive to everolimus and chloroquine and the pharmacological combination everolimus/chloroquine was strongly synergistic inducing cell viability inhibition. In details, the pharmacological synergism occurs when chloroquine is administered before everolimus. In addition, we found a flow autophagic block and shift of death mechanisms to apoptosis. This event was associated with decrease of Beclin-1/Bcl(-)2 complex and parallel reduction of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl(-)2 in combined treatment. At last, we found that the enhancement of apoptosis induced by drug combination occurs through the intrinsic mitochondrial apoptotic pathway activation, while the extrinsic pathway is involved only partly following its activation by chloroquine. These results provide the basis for new therapeutic strategies for the treatment of renal cell carcinoma after appropriate clinical trial.

The initial rationale for using autophagy inhibition was generated by research revealing that autophagy is upregulated in response to external stresses, including chemotherapy and radiotherapy.

Recent research has shown that some cancer cells, particularly those driven by the K-Ras oncogene, also depend on elevated levels of autophagy for survival even in the absence of external stressors. In multiple in vitro as well as in vivo systems, oncogenic Ras-mediated transformation and tumor growth are dependent on autophagy to evade metabolic stress and cell death. These studies have subsequently led to further early phase clinical testing whether autophagy inhibition is a viable and effective strategy for targeting Ras-driven tumors. Even before the clinical results are available from these ongoing clinical trials, much work remains to optimally develop the approach of autophagy inhibition clinically; most notably reliably detecting levels of autophagy in human tumor samples, pharmacodynamics of currently available autophagy inhibitors (chloroquine and the derivative hydroxychloroquine), and new target identification and drug development.","IncludeStatus":"Exclude","LisedInColA":"No Label","originalFormulation":"No Label","AloneOrComb":"No Label","cancerType":"No Label","studyType":"No Label","therapeuticAssociation":"No Label"},{"id":"126","Drug":"Chloroquine","PMID":"23477322","Title":"Attacking breast cancer at the preinvasion stage by targeting autophagy","Authors":"Espina V, Wysolmerski J, Edmiston K, Liotta LA.","Citation":"Womens Health (Lond). 2013 Mar;9(2):157-70. doi: 10.2217/whe.13.5.","CreatedDate":"3/13/13","Abstract":"Preinvasive breast carcinoma cells that proliferate and accumulate within the nonvascular, closed intraductal niche are under severe hypoxic and metabolic stress.

Mean glucose and immunoreactive insulin levels (+/- SEM) before and after therapy were 80 +/- 40 mg/dl versus 70 +/- 50 mg/dl and 216 +/- 12 microU/ml versus 198 +/- 22 microU/ml, respectively. These were not significantly different. The patient\'s five-month-old malignant insulinoma monolayer cell culture was incubated with pentamidine (60 micrograms/ml) in the presence or absence of supplemented stimulatory medium consisting of glucose (300 mg/dl) and theophylline (20 micrograms/ml). Chloroquine (60 micrograms/ml) was added to inhibit lysosomal degradation of immunoreactive insulin. Aliquots of media for immunoreactive insulin determination were obtained at 30 minutes, 20 hours, 72 hours, and three weeks. The cells were examined by high-power light microscopy at each time interval. At 30 minutes, pentamidine alone caused passive release of immunoreactive insulin, 23 percent higher than control (p less than 0.01).

Pentamidine plus stimulatory medium had no additive effect on immunoreactive insulin released within 30 minutes. At the end of 20 hours, immunoreactive insulin was no different with pentamidine and/or stimulatory medium. However, the addition of chloroquine increased immunoreactive insulin by 35 percent above the medium with pentamidine and stimulatory medium (p less than 0.01).

High-power microscopy demonstrated intact cells in the control medium, whereas no cell structure could be detected in the media containing pentamidine at three weeks. In summary, pentamidine had no acute in vivo effect in a patient with malignant insulinoma. However, when used in an in vitro monolayer system, pentamidine caused (1) acute immunoreactive insulin release followed by inhibition of immunoreactive insulin secretion and (2) cytolysis of human malignant insulinoma cells in vitro.","IncludeStatus":"Include","LisedInColA":"No","originalFormulation":"Yes","AloneOrComb":"Combination","cancerType":"Pancreas","studyType":"Preclinical in-vitro","therapeuticAssociation":"No effect"},{"id":"133","Drug":"Chloroquine","PMID":"3056688","Title":"[Transfusion malaria in promyelocytic leukemia]","Authors":"Shunkert H, Handt S, de Wit M, Gladziwa U, Gl\u221a\u2202ckner WM, Sieberth HG.","Citation":"Dtsch Med Wochenschr. 1988 Nov 25;113(47):1841-3. doi: 10.1055/s-2008-1067898.","CreatedDate":"11/25/88","Abstract":"Five weeks after re-induction treatment and nine days after discharge from hospital, remittent fever occurred in a 34-year-old woman with promyelocytic leukaemia in full remission.

To summarize published evidence on the causes, diagnosis, therapy, prevention, and prognosis of pericarditis. A literature search of BioMedCentral, Google Scholar, MEDLINE, Scopus, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews was performed for human studies without language restriction from January 1, 1990, to August 31, 2015. After literature review and selection of meta-analyses, randomized clinical trials, and large observational studies, 30 studies (5 meta-analyses, 10 randomized clinical trials, and 16 cohort studies) with 7569 adult patients were selected for inclusion. The etiology of pericarditis may be infectious (eg, viral and bacterial) or noninfectious (eg, systemic inflammatory diseases, cancer, and post-cardiac injury syndromes). Tuberculosis is a major cause of pericarditis in developing countries but accounts for less than 5% of cases in developed countries, where idiopathic, presumed viral causes are responsible for 80% to 90% of cases. The diagnosis is based on clinical criteria including chest pain, a pericardial rub, electrocardiographic changes, and pericardial effusion. Certain features at presentation (temperature >38\xb0C [>100.4\xb0F], subacute course, large effusion or tamponade, and failure of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug [NSAID] treatment) indicate a poorer prognosis and identify patients requiring hospital admission. The most common treatment for idiopathic and viral pericarditis in North America and Europe is NSAID therapy. Adjunctive colchicine can ameliorate the initial episode and is associated with approximately 50% lower recurrence rates. Corticosteroids are a second-line therapy for those who do not respond, are intolerant, or have contraindications to NSAIDs and colchicine. Recurrences may occur in 30% of patients without preventive therapy. Pericarditis is the most common form of pericardial disease worldwide and may recur in as many as one-third of patients who present with idiopathic or viral pericarditis. Appropriate triage and treatment with NSAIDs may reduce readmission rates for pericarditis.

In addition to antituberculous chemotherapy, treatments include corticosteroids, drainage, and surgery. To assess the effects of treatments for tuberculous pericarditis. We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register (27 March 2017); the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), published in the Cochrane Library (2017, Issue 2); MEDLINE (1966 to 27 March 2017); Embase (1974 to 27 March 2017); and LILACS (1982 to 27 March 2017). In addition we searched the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) search portal using \'tuberculosis\' and \'pericard*\' as search terms on 27 March 2017. We searched ClinicalTrials.gov and contacted researchers in the field of tuberculous pericarditis. This is a new version of the original 2002 review. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs. Two review authors independently screened search outputs, evaluated study eligibility, assessed risk of bias, and extracted data; and we resolved any discrepancies by discussion and consensus. One trial assessed the effects of both corticosteroid and Mycobacterium indicus pranii treatment in a two-by-two factorial design; we excluded data from the group that received both interventions. We conducted fixed-effect meta-analysis and assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. Seven trials met the inclusion criteria; all were from sub-Saharan Africa and included 1959 participants, with 1051/1959 (54%) HIV-positive. All trials evaluated corticosteroids and one each evaluated colchicine, M. indicus pranii immunotherapy, and open surgical drainage. Four trials (1841 participants) were at low risk of bias, and three trials (118 participants) were at high risk of bias.In people who are not infected with HIV, corticosteroids may reduce deaths from all causes (risk ratio (RR) 0.80, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.59 to 1.09; 660 participants, 4 trials, low certainty evidence) and the need for repeat pericardiocentesis (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.04; 492 participants, 2 trials, low certainty evidence). Corticosteroids probably reduce deaths from pericarditis (RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.80; 660 participants, 4 trials, moderate certainty evidence). However, we do not know whether or not corticosteroids have an effect on constriction or cancer among HIV-negative people (very low certainty evidence).In people living with HIV, only 19.9% (203/1959) were on antiretroviral drugs. Corticosteroids may reduce constriction (RR 0.55, 0.26 to 1.16; 575 participants, 3 trials, low certainty evidence). It is uncertain whether corticosteroids have an effect on all-cause death or cancer (very low certainty evidence); and may have little or no effect on repeat pericardiocentesis (RR 1.02, 0.89 to 1.18; 517 participants, 2 trials, low certainty evidence).For colchicine among people living with HIV, we found one small trial (33 participants) which had insufficient data to make any conclusions about any effects on death or constrictive pericarditis.Irrespective of HIV status, due to very low certainty evidence from one trial, it is uncertain whether adding M. indicus pranii immunotherapy to antituberculous drugs has an effect on any outcome.Open surgical drainage for effusion may reduce repeat pericardiocentesis In HIV-negative people (RR 0.23, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.76; 122 participants, 1 trial, low certainty evidence) but may make little or no difference to other outcomes. We did not find an eligible trial that assessed the effects of open surgical drainage in people living with HIV.The review authors found no eligible trials that examined the length of antituberculous treatment needed nor the effects of other adjunctive treatments for tuberculous pericarditis. For HIV-negative patients, corticosteroids may reduce death. For HIV-positive patients not on antiretroviral drugs, corticosteroids may reduce constriction. For HIV-positive patients with good antiretroviral drug viral suppression, clinicians may consider the results from HIV-negative patients more relevant.Further research may help evaluate percutaneous drainage of the pericardium under local anaesthesia, the timing of pericardiectomy in tuberculous constrictive pericarditis, and new antibiotic regimens.","IncludeStatus":"Exclude","LisedInColA":"No Label","originalFormulation":"No Label","AloneOrComb":"No Label","cancerType":"No Label","studyType":"No Label","therapeuticAssociation":"No Label"},{"id":"136","Drug":"Colchicine","PMID":"28417463","Title":"Pharmacological interventions for primary sclerosing cholangitis: an attempted network meta-analysis","Authors":"Saffioti F, Gurusamy KS, Hawkins N, Toon CD, Tsochatzis E, Davidson BR, Thorburn D.","Citation":"Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2017 Mar 28;3(3):CD011343. doi: 10.1002/14651858.CD011343.pub2.

The optimal pharmacological treatment for patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis remains controversial. To assess the comparative benefits and harms of different pharmacological interventions in people with primary sclerosing cholangitis by performing a network meta-analysis, and to generate rankings of available pharmacological interventions according to their safety and efficacy. Given that it was not possible to assess whether potential effect modifiers were similar across comparisons, we did not perform the network meta-analysis but instead used standard Cochrane methods.When trials begin to provide an adequate description of potential effect modifiers, we will attempt to conduct network meta-analysis. We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Science Citation Index - Expanded, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and randomised controlled trials registers until February 2017 to identify randomised clinical trials (RCT) on pharmacological interventions for primary sclerosing cholangitis. We included only RCTs, irrespective of language, blinding, or publication status, in which participants were given a diagnosis of primary sclerosing cholangitis. We excluded trials that included previously liver-transplanted participants. We considered any of various pharmacological interventions compared with one other or with placebo. We excluded trials that compared different doses of various pharmacological interventions or that reported different treatment durations, except for ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA). As UDCA is the drug most commonly investigated for primary sclerosing cholangitis, we performed a second analysis in which we stratified the dose of UDCA. We calculated the odds ratio and the rate ratio with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using both fixed-effect and random-effects models based on available-participant analysis with Review Manager. We assessed risk of bias according to Cochrane, controlled risk of random errors with Trial Sequential Analysis, and assessed the quality of the evidence using GRADE. We identified 22 RCTs in which 1211 participants were randomised to 13 different interventions. Most were placebo-controlled trials. Trials had few restrictions apart from an established diagnosis of primary sclerosing cholangitis, evidence of cholestasis, absence of decompensated liver disease, and absence of malignancy. However, some trials included symptomatic participants only, and others included both symptomatic and asymptomatic participants. A total of 11 RCTs (706 participants) provided data for one or more outcomes. The period of follow-up ranged from three months to three years in most trials. Only three trials reported follow-up longer than three years. Investigators found no evidence of differences in important clinical benefits such as reduction in mortality at maximal follow-up and improvement in health-related quality of life. Primary outcomes Mortality: Effect estimates: colchicine versus placebo: odds ratio 0.44, 95% CI 0.04 to 5.07, participants = 84, one trial; penicillamine versus placebo: odds ratio 1.18, 95% CI 0.39 to 3.58, participants = 70, one trial; steroids versus placebo: odds ratio 3.00, 95% CI 0.10 to 90.96, participants = 11, one trial; ursodeoxycholic acid versus placebo: odds ratio 1.51, 95% CI 0.63 to 3.63, participants = 348, two trials, I<sup>2</sup> = 0%; vancomycin versus placebo: not estimable because no events in either group, participants = 29, one trial. Serious adverse events (proportion): Effect estimates: infliximab versus placebo: odds ratio not estimable (because of zero events in both arms), participants = 7, one trial; steroids versus placebo: odds ratio 20.00, 95% CI 0.93 to 429.90, participants = 11, one trial; vancomycin versus placebo: not estimable because no events in either group, participants = 29, one trial. Serious adverse events (number): Effect estimates: infliximab versus placebo: rate ratio 0.80, 95% CI 0.02 to 40.44, participants = 7, one trial; penicillamine versus placebo: rate ratio 13.60, 95% CI 0.78 to 237.83, participants = 70, one trial; steroids versus placebo: rate ratio 3.32, 95% CI 0.71 to 15.62, participants = 11, one trial. Adverse events (proportion): Effect estimates: steroids versus placebo: odds ratio 20.00, 95% CI 0.93 to 429.90, participants = 11, one trial; ursodeoxycholic acid versus placebo: odds ratio 1.22, 95% CI 0.68 to 2.17, participants = 198, one trial; vancomycin versus placebo: not estimable because no events in either group, participants = 29, one trial. Adverse events (number): Effect estimates: cyclosporin versus placebo: rate ratio 2.64, 95% CI 0.99 to 7.03, participants = 26, one trial; steroids versus placebo: rate ratio 3.32, 95% CI 0.71 to 15.62, participants = 11, one trial; ursodeoxycholic acid plus metronidazole versus ursodeoxycholic acid: rate ratio 2.36, 95% CI 0.98 to 5.71, participants = 71, one trial. Health-related quality of life: ursodeoxycholic acid versus placebo: mean difference 1.30, 95% CI -5.61 to 8.21, participants = 198, one trial (Short Form (SF)-36 General Health Scale). Secondary outcomes Studies provided no evidence of differences in clinical benefits such as a reduction in the requirement for liver transplantation or a reduction in the incidence proportion of cholangiocarcinoma. One small trial (29 participants) comparing vancomycin versus placebo reported no malignancies, no liver decompensation, and no liver transplantation in either group after a very short follow-up period of 12 weeks after treatment. None of the remaining trials clearly reported other clinical benefits such as decreased development of all malignancies, colorectal cancer, liver decompensation, time to liver decompensation, time to liver transplantation, or requirement for cholecystectomy to allow comparisons between different interventions. Fifteen trials reported the source of funding; three were funded by parties without vested interest in results of the trial, and 12 were funded in part or in full by drug companies. Evidence is currently insufficient to show differences in effectiveness measures such as mortality, health-related quality of life, cirrhosis, or liver transplantation between any active pharmacological intervention and no intervention. However, trials were at high risk of bias and included small numbers of participants, had short follow-up periods, and reported few clinical outcomes. An urgent need exists to identify an effective medical treatment for primary sclerosing cholangitis through well-designed RCTs with adequate follow-up that aim to identify differences in outcomes important to people with primary sclerosing cholangitis.","IncludeStatus":"Exclude","LisedInColA":"No Label","originalFormulation":"No Label","AloneOrComb":"No Label","cancerType":"No Label","studyType":"No Label","therapeuticAssociation":"No Label"},{"id":"137","Drug":"Colchicine","PMID":"31106148","Title":"Glesatinib, a c-MET/SMO Dual Inhibitor, Antagonizes P-glycoprotein Mediated Multidrug Resistance in Cancer Cells","Authors":"Cui Q, Cai CY, Gao HL, Ren L, Ji N, Gupta P, Yang Y, Shukla S, Ambudkar SV, Yang DH, Chen ZS.","Citation":"Front Oncol. 2019 Apr 25;9:313. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2019.00313. eCollection 2019.","CreatedDate":"5/21/19","Abstract":"Multidrug resistance (MDR) is one of the leading causes of treatment failure in cancer chemotherapy.

Furthermore, glesatinib can stimulate ATPase in a dose-dependent manner. The docking study indicated that glesatinib interacted with human P-gp through several hydrogen bonds.

Indibulin treatment also perturbed the localization of end-binding proteins at the growing microtubule ends in MCF-7 cells. Indibulin reduced inter-kinetochoric tension, produced aberrant spindles, activated mitotic checkpoint proteins Mad2 and BubR1, and induced mitotic arrest in MCF-7 cells. Indibulin-treated MCF-7 cells underwent apoptosis-mediated cell death. Further, the combination of indibulin with an anticancer drug vinblastine was found to exert synergistic cytotoxic effects on MCF-7 cells. Interestingly, indibulin displayed a stronger effect on the undifferentiated neuroblastoma (SH-SY5Y) cells than the differentiated neuronal cells. Unlike indibulin, vinblastine and colchicine produced similar depolymerizing effects on microtubules in both differentiated and undifferentiated SH-SY5Y cells.

The main treatment is colchicine which prevents attacks in the majority of patients except for a group of colchicine-resistant cases. Chronic hepatitis C is a viral infection causing chronic inflammation of liver tissue (hepatitis) which ultimately progresses to fibrosis and liver cirrhosis with a high chance of hepatocellular carcinoma. However, we found no data in the literature concerning the impact of hepatitis C on the course of attacks of familial Mediterranean fever. We report a case of a 21-year-old white woman with familial Mediterranean fever who had not been responding to a high dose of colchicine (2\xa0mg/day). She presented to our clinic with a finding of chronic hepatitis C genotype 3 infection. After successful antiviral therapy with peginterferon and ribavirin, she became attack-free for 2 years and went on to a lower dose of colchicine. This unusual case illustrates complete resolution of attacks of autoinflammatory disease after drug-induced clearance of chronic hepatitis C infection. Coexisting infections should be viewed as potentially altering the course of autoinflammatory disorders, and any attempt to cure the infections should be made in order to gain an added value of benefiting the chronic disease. This case highlights the interrelation of external pathogen-related and genetically inherited alterations in immunity and the importance of considering the whole spectrum of possible causative factors rather than implementing separate guidelines in order to achieve best quality of medical care in any given patient.","IncludeStatus":"Exclude","LisedInColA":"No Label","originalFormulation":"No Label","AloneOrComb":"No Label","cancerType":"No Label","studyType":"No Label","therapeuticAssociation":"No Label"},{"id":"141","Drug":"Colchicine","PMID":"28533874","Title":"[Cardiac pseudotumor revealing Beh\u221a\xdfet\'s disease]","Authors":"Nya F, Abdou A, Bamous M, Moutakiallah Y, Atmani N, Seghrouchni A, Houssa MA, Boulahya A.","Citation":"Pan Afr Med J. 2017 Mar 15;26:151. doi: 10.11604/pamj.2017.26.151.11478. eCollection 2017.","CreatedDate":"5/24/17","Abstract":"Intracardiac thrombosis is a rare complication of Beh\xe7et\'s disease (BD), which may manifest as intracardiac tumor.

One major study conducted on an analogue of allocolchicine, ZD 6126, was halted in phase 2 clinical trials due to severe cardio-toxicity associated with treatment. This study involves the development and testing of novel allocolchicine analogues that hold non-toxic anti-cancer properties. Currently we have synthesized and evaluated the anti-cancer activities of two analogues; N-acetyl-O-methylcolchinol (NSC 51046 or NCME), which is structurally similar to ZD 6126, and (S)-3,8,9,10-tetramethoxyallocolchicine (Green 1), which is a novel derivative of allocolchicine that is isomeric in the A ring. NSC 51046 was found to be non-selective as it induced apoptosis in both BxPC-3 and PANC-1 pancreatic cancer cells and in normal human fibroblasts. Interestingly, we found that Green 1 was able to modestly induce pro-death autophagy in these pancreatic cancer cells and E6-1 leukemia cells but not in normal human fibroblasts. Unlike colchicine and NSC 51046, Green 1 does not appear to affect tubulin polymerization indicating that it has a different molecular target. Green 1 also caused increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in mitochondria isolated from pancreatic cancer cells. Furthermore, in vivo studies revealed that Green 1 was well tolerated in mice. Our findings suggest that a small change in the structure of colchicine has apparently changed the mechanism of action and lead to improved selectivity.

At present, the antitubulin development pipeline contains an armful of agents under clinical investigation. This review focuses on novel tubulin inhibitors as cancer therapeutics. The article covers the agents which have completed the phase II studies along with the agents demonstrating promising results in phase I studies. Countless clinical trials evaluating the efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics of novel tubulin inhibitors highlights the scientific efforts being paid to establish their candidature as cancer therapeutics. Colchicine binding site inhibitors as vascular disrupting agents (VDAs) and new taxanes appear to be the most likely agents for future clinical interest. Numerous agents have demonstrated clinical benefits in terms of efficacy and survival in phase I and II studies. However conclusive benefits can only be ascertained on the basis of phase III studies.","IncludeStatus":"Exclude","LisedInColA":"No Label","originalFormulation":"No Label","AloneOrComb":"No Label","cancerType":"No Label","studyType":"No Label","therapeuticAssociation":"No Label"},{"id":"148","Drug":"Colchicine","PMID":"29581813","Title":"Atypical Presentation of Acute Myeloid Leukemia","Authors":"Agrawal K, Miles L, Agrawal N, Khan A.","Citation":"World J Oncol. 2018 Feb;9(1):29-34. doi: 10.14740/wjon1083w.

In this study, the MDR-modulated effect of paired tamoxifen and colchicine on vinblastine and the possible additive effect of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) were investigated in the treatment of advanced RCC. Chemotherapy was administered every 4 weeks with biweekly vinblastine (4 mg/m(2)/day, intravenously on days 1 and 15) modulated by oral tamoxifen (100 mg/day) and colchicine (1 mg/day) from days -1 to 2 and from days 13 to 16. 5-FU (800 mg/m(2)/day from days 2 to 5) was administered after vinblastine administration as a continuous infusion.

This agent binds to the colchicine site on ss-tubulin and inhibits polymerization of microtubules. This disruption of microtubule dynamics leads to a block in the cell cycle at the G2/M phase, and promotes apoptosis. ABT-751, as a single agent, has antitumor activity against a series of xenograft models including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and colon cancer. The current studies were conducted to determine whether ABT-751 enhances antitumor activity of standard cytotoxic therapies currently in clinical use. Efficacy of ABT-751, in combination with cisplatin, 5-FU, and radiation, was evaluated in the Calu-6 NSCLC, HT-29 colon, and HCT-116 colon carcinoma xenograft models, respectively. Tumor-bearing athymic mice were treated with ABT-751 orally once a day at 75 or 100 mg/kg/day on a 5-days-on, 5-days-off schedule for two cycles. Efficacy of ABT-751 at 100 mg/kg/day was tested in combination with cisplatin at its maximum tolerable dose (MTD) (10 mg/kg/day, i.p. x1) in Calu-6 tumor-bearing athymic mice. The percent treated/control (%T/C) tumor volume ratios on day 38 were 35, 37, and 6, and the percent tumor growth delay (%TGD) values were 71, 65, and 188 for cisplatin, ABT-751 and the combination groups, respectively. HT-29 colon tumors were used to test ABT-751 in combination with an MTD of 5-FU, 30 mg/kg/day, i.p., q.d. x5. The %T/C ratios on day 38 were 22, 28, and 5 and the %TGD values were 75, 75, and 150 for 5-FU, ABT-751, and the combination groups, respectively. Treatment of HCT-116 colon carcinoma tumors with ABT-751, concurrent with the radiation treatment, was able to both enhance radiation-induced tumor regression, and delay the time to recurrence and progression. Growth curves allowed calculation of enhancement of radiation-induced growth delay (defined as the additional time required for a treated tumor to reach four times its original size) of 2, 9, and 12 days, for ABT-751 alone, radiation alone, and the combination, respectively. Collectively, these studies demonstrate that ABT-751 enhanced efficacy of standard cytotoxic therapies in a variety of tumor xenograft models, and that enhancement was at least additive in all systems.","IncludeStatus":"Include","LisedInColA":"No","originalFormulation":"Don\'t know","AloneOrComb":"Combination","cancerType":"Bowel","studyType":"Preclinical in-vivo","therapeuticAssociation":"Effective"},{"id":"153","Drug":"Colchicine","PMID":"11901539","Title":"A phase II study of CI-980 in previously untreated extensive small cell lung cancer: an Ohio State University phase II research consortium study","Authors":"Thomas JP, Moore T, Kraut EH, Balcerzak SP, Galloway S, Vandre DD; Ohio State University Phase II Research Consortium Study.","Citation":"Cancer Invest. 2002;20(2):192-8. doi: 10.1081/cnv-120001146.","CreatedDate":"3/21/02","Abstract":"CI-980, (ethyl (S)-(5-amino-1,2-dihydro-2-methyl-3-phenylpyrido[3,4-b] pyrazine-7-yl) carbamate 2-hydroxyethansulfonate (1:1)), is a water-soluble mitotic inhibitor. It acts by binding to the colchicine-binding site on tubulin, a site different from that of the vinca alkaloids, inhibiting tubulin polymerization. Cells exposed to CI-980 accumulate in M phase and die. In preclinical tumor models, CI-980 showed a broad spectrum of activity, including in multi-drug resistant tumor cell lines, with activity at least equal to that of vincristine. Extensive small cell lung cancer, despite its responsiveness to chemotherapy, is usually an incurable disease with survival in patients of less than one year. Due to the preclinical activity of CI-980 and its similar mechanism of action to drugs effective in small cell lung cancer, a phase II trial in extensive small cell lung cancer was initiated by The Ohio State University Phase II Research Consortium. A \\"window of opportunity\\" design was chosen where a short six-week trial of the drug was given unless there was significant objective response. Twelve patients were entered in the study and underwent a total of 16 cycles of chemotherapy. The median age of the patients was 54 years old (range 34-71) and performance status was ECOG 0 (four patients), ECOG 1 (seven patients), and ECOG 2 (one patient). The patients were treated with a 72-hr infusion at a dose of 4.5 mg/m2/day. Toxicity was predominantly myelosuppression with granulocytopenia (nine episodes), and anemia (seven episodes). There were no objective responses with 11 patients being removed from study due to progressive disease. Evaluation of leukocyte microtubule structure in peripheral blood revealed microtubule depolymerization, which was seen after treatment (t = 72 hr) and was reversible within 24 hr of stopping the drug. We conclude that despite antitumor activity demonstrated in preclinical studies, CI-980 does not have biological activity in previously untreated small cell lung cancer at this dose and infusion protocol.","IncludeStatus":"Include","LisedInColA":"No","originalFormulation":"Yes","AloneOrComb":"Combination","cancerType":"Lung","studyType":"Clinical trial","therapeuticAssociation":"No effect"},{"id":"154","Drug":"Colchicine","PMID":"11552915","Title":"Ten-year combination treatment with colchicine and ursodeoxycholic acid for primary biliary cirrhosis: a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial on symptomatic patients","Authors":"Battezzati PM, Zuin M, Crosignani A, Allocca M, Invernizzi P, Selmi C, Villa E, Podda M.","Citation":"Aliment Pharmacol Ther. 2001 Sep;15(9):1427-34. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2036.2001.01018.x.","CreatedDate":"9/13/01","Abstract":"Combined medical treatment may provide further benefit to primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) patients administered ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA).

By preventing cell division after smooth muscle cell activation, antimitogenic therapy may inhibit the final common pathway in this complex chain of events and offset the apparent loss of local growth control. Colchicine, which causes metaphase arrest of cell division, has been shown in experimental studies to decrease the extent of atheromatous plaque formation and reduce the severity of arterial restenosis after balloon angioplasty. However, preliminary results from a randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial suggest that low dose colchicine (0.6 mg twice a day orally) does not prevent restenosis. The use of more potent antineoplastic agents is limited by the potential for life-threatening side effects. It is possible that these adverse effects can be averted by using novel drug delivery systems to administer antimitogenic therapy locally at the site of arterial injury or by using low dose synergistic combinations of antiproliferative agents. This review examines the potential role of antimitogenic therapy in the prevention of restenosis after coronary interventions and considers the possibility of an overlap of the therapeutic realms of interventional cardiology and medical oncology.","IncludeStatus":"Exclude","LisedInColA":"No Label","originalFormulation":"No Label","AloneOrComb":"No Label","cancerType":"No Label","studyType":"No Label","therapeuticAssociation":"No Label"},{"id":"161","Drug":"Colchicine","PMID":"17177066","Title":"Long-term colchicine therapy in a patient with Beh\u221a\xdfet\'s disease and acute promyelocytic leukemia","Authors":"Ozdogu H, Boga C, Yilmaz Z, Sahin FI, Bal N.","Citation":"Rheumatol Int. 2007 Jun;27(8):763-5. doi: 10.1007/s00296-006-0285-2.

The question addressed was: in patients with hypertrophic and keloid scarring of the sternotomy wound, is surgical excision with or without adjuvant treatment of any benefit in reducing the size of the scar? Altogether, more than 15 papers were found using the reported search, of which nine represented the best evidence to answer the clinical question. The authors, journal, date and country of publication, patient group studied, study type, relevant outcomes and results of these papers are tabulated. One of the studies showed no difference between surgery and adjunctive triamcinolone or colchicine. One study showed that incomplete excision resulted in higher recurrence rates. Postoperative radiation was found to be useful in two of the studies, although one study showed that it was not useful. One randomized control trial showed improvement after laser compared to no treatment. Two other trials showed no difference between laser, silicone gel, intralesional steroid or 5-fluorouracil. One trial showed that perioperative systemic steroid application gave rise to no improvement but in fact worsened scar formation. We conclude that small keloids can be treated radically by surgery with adjuvant therapy (radiation or corticosteroid injections) or by non-surgical therapy (corticosteroid injections, laser and anti-tumour/immunosuppressive agents, such as 5-fluorouracil). Large and multiple keloids are difficult to treat radically and are currently only treatable by multimodal therapies that aim to relieve symptoms.","IncludeStatus":"Exclude","LisedInColA":"No Label","originalFormulation":"No Label","AloneOrComb":"No Label","cancerType":"No Label","studyType":"No Label","therapeuticAssociation":"No Label"},{"id":"164","Drug":"Colchicine","PMID":"32268262","Title":"Immunomodulatory treatment of immune checkpoint inhibitor-induced myocarditis: Pathway toward precision-based therapy","Authors":"Balanescu DV, Donisan T, Palaskas N, Lopez-Mattei J, Kim PY, Buja LM, McNamara DM, Kobashigawa JA, Durand JB, Iliescu CA.","Citation":"Cardiovasc Pathol. 2020 Feb 14;47:107211. doi: 10.1016/j.carpath.2020.107211.

We aimed to describe ICI-induced myocarditis by presenting findings of comprehensive cardiovascular evaluations and outcomes of patients following a therapeutic approach similar to autoimmune disorders or allograft transplant rejection, and to discuss the molecular basis of the benefits of immune modulation and statins in ICI-myocarditis. Three patients with ICI-induced myocarditis (2 with positive biopsies and 1 based on cardiac magnetic resonance imaging with negative biopsy) underwent a complete cardiovascular workup, including cardiac catheterization with endomyocardial biopsy. Treatment was with intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) and statins in all cases, with additional colchicine (2 cases) or hydroxychloroquine (1 case). Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated varied subsets of T cells involved in the inflammatory response. Therapy with IVIG and statins led to symptom resolution and cardiac function normalization at 1-month follow-up in all patients. Cancer therapy was resumed in all patients. One patient expired 10 months after the myocarditis episode due to advanced malignancy; two patients were alive, free of heart failure symptoms and cancer progression, at 1-year follow-up, and 1 patient was rechallenged with ICI. We suggest that treatment with IVIG and statins may allow for a prompt resumption of anti-cancer therapy (including ICI) and improve outcomes.","IncludeStatus":"Exclude","LisedInColA":"No Label","originalFormulation":"No Label","AloneOrComb":"No Label","cancerType":"No Label","studyType":"No Label","therapeuticAssociation":"No Label"},{"id":"165","Drug":"Colchicine","PMID":"9740549","Title":"Phase II study of CI-980 (NSC 635370) in patients with previously treated advanced soft-tissue sarcomas","Authors":"Patel SR, Burgess MA, Papadopolous NE, Sidhu G, Gray R, Plager C, Jenkins J, Benjamin RS.","Citation":"Invest New Drugs. 1998;16(1):87-92. doi: 10.1023/a:1006078930550.","CreatedDate":"9/18/98","Abstract":"Doxorubicin and ifosfamide are the two most active agents in the treatment of soft-tissue sarcomas.

The upper extremities were involved in the majority of patients (83.3%). Correlations were found between edema of the superficial dermis and vesiculobullous lesions and between leukocytoclastic vasculitis and atypical targetoid lesions. Sweet\'s syndrome was associated with cytomegalovirus infection (n = 1), inflammatory bowel disease (n = 4), neoplasm (n = 6), and pregnancy (n = 3). First-line treatment consisted of colchicine. To the best of the present authors\' knowledge, this is the largest series of SS to be reported. Clinical presentations are similar to those described in the literature.

Studies have shown that 2ME2 is metabolized by conjugation at positions 3 and 17 and oxidation at position 17. To define structure-activity relationships for these positions of 2ME2 and to generate metabolically stable analogues with improved anti-tubulin properties, a series of analogues was generated and three lead analogues were selected, ENMD-1198, ENMD-1200, and ENMD-1237. These molecules showed improved metabolic stability with >65% remaining after 2-h incubation with hepatocytes. Pharmacokinetic studies showed that oral administration of the compounds resulted in increased plasma levels compared with 2ME2. All three analogues bind the colchicine binding site of tubulin, induce G(2)-M cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, and reduce hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha levels. ENMD-1198 and ENMD-1200 showed improved in vitro antiproliferative activities. Significant reductions in tumor volumes compared with vehicle-treated mice were observed in an orthotopic breast carcinoma (MDA-MB-231) xenograft model following daily oral treatment with all compounds (ANOVA, P < 0.05).

Ten days after the first treatment cycle, giant, painful oral ulcerations were noted but they resolved spontaneously. One week after the second cycle, further oral ulceration appeared, this time with a papulonodular skin rash.

The prevalence of the disease varies widely and is high in the Eastern Mediterranean Basin, North Africa, Iran and Japan. Many clinical features of Beh\xe7et\'s disease have been described and the international study group for Beh\xe7et\'s disease has defined a set of diagnostic criteria. These require the presence of recurrent oral ulcers plus two of the following: recurrent genital ulcerations, typical defined eye lesions, typical defined skin lesions or a positive pathergy test (a skin hypersensitivity reaction to a non-specific physical insult; when positive, the response consists of a papule or pustule that develops after 24 to 48 hours at the site of a needle prick to the skin). Although not included in these diagnostic criteria, there are some other features commonly seen in patients with Beh\xe7et\'s disease: thrombophlebitis, oligo-arthritis, gastrointestinal ulcerations and neurological involvement. Neuro-Beh\xe7et is well described in Beh\xe7et\'s disease, with variable prevalence rates between 5.3 and 35%. This prevalence is probably affected by the type of study (retrospective or prospective) and regional and ethnic variations in disease expression. Psychiatric symptoms usually occur as incidental findings in some patients with neurological disease; they are misdiagnosed and mistreated. The patient described here developed acute psychotic symptoms without parenchymal cerebral involvement, and negative symptoms during Beh\xe7et\'s disease. Two hypotheses were evoked: schizophrenia associated with Beh\xe7et\'s disease versus psychiatric syndrome induced by vasculitis. Such a case has not been reported in the literature. We describe the case of a 31-year-old Haitian female, admitted because of an acute psychosis. She developed hallucination, misrecognition, psychomotor hyperactivity and delusion about her million childbirths. The patient had three years history of mistreated Beh\xe7et\'s disease, in particular recurrent oral ulcers, iritis and cardiovascular manifestations. She also had a history of uterine tumour, rectal carcinoid tumour and recurrent pleurisies. One year ago, she presented breast lymphangitis, anxiety, unusual thought content, hostility, suspiciousness, and poor impulse control: cranial computerised tomography scan was normal. After ten days of hospitalization, she complained of oral and genital aphta and no neurological sign was found. The cerebral angiographic magnetic resonance imaging showed a thrombophlebitis of the left lateral sinus without parenchymal involvement. Haloperidol, Heparin, Colchicine, Cyclophosphamide and Prednisone were introduced. Six months after, delirium and Beh\xe7et\'s symptoms had disappeared with the following treatment: Risperidone, Alprazolam, Zolpidem, Colchicine, Prednisone, and Azathioprine. The patient has developed enduring negative symptoms: blunted affect, social withdrawal, difficulty in abstract thinking, lack of spontaneity and flow of conversation and poor rapport. They are still present. This patient had two acute psychotic symptoms without parenchymal pattern. After treatment, she had persistent negative symptoms and psychosocial deterioration. This evolution is commonly seen in schizophrenia. Retrospective analysis of this patient\'s course suggests that -psychiatric episodes were always associated with physical manifestations. However, pleurisies, lymphangitis, uterine and rectal tumours have never been described in Beh\xe7et\'s disease. This vasculitis occurs less frequently in the Caribbean than in Mediterranean, Middle East or Japan. It seemed that this patient had a psychotic syndrome and a chronic relapsing multisystem disorder, more complex than Beh\xe7et\'s disease. A prospective study would be useful to characterize psychiatric patterns of Beh\xe7et\'s disease and establish their relationships with physical manifestations, especially neurological involvement.","IncludeStatus":"Exclude","LisedInColA":"No Label","originalFormulation":"No Label","AloneOrComb":"No Label","cancerType":"No Label","studyType":"No Label","therapeuticAssociation":"No Label"},{"id":"190","Drug":"Colchicine","PMID":"19744393","Title":"[Recurrent pericardial effusion due to familiar Mediterranean fever]","Authors":"Halabe-Cherem J, Hamui-Sutton A, Cohen-Cohen S, Sacal-Dumani E, Shuchleib-Cung A, Nellen-Hummel H, R\u221a\xb0bago-Arredondo J.","Citation":"Rev Med Inst Mex Seguro Soc. 2009 Mar-Apr;47(2):211-4.","CreatedDate":"9/12/09","Abstract":"Pericarditis is usually a complication of viral or bacterial infection.

Secondary amyloidosis (AA) is a rare but serious complication that occurs in the context of cancer, chronic inflammation and chronic infectious diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease, mainly long-standing Crohn\'s disease. Renal failure is the most common clinical presentation of AA, ranging from nephrotic syndrome and impaired renal function to renal failure, with a potential for high morbidity. The incidence of the association of secondary amyloidosis in patients with Crohn\'s disease has been reported to be 0.5%-8%. We present a case of a 39-year-old male patient diagnosed with Crohn\'s disease at age 21 and submitted to right hemicolectomy because of ileus 17 years before. Thereafter, he was treated with corticosteroids for 15 years and with azathioprine for a short period; in the last three years he was on therapy with mesalazine alone. He was hospitalized due to worsening clinical condition and re-evaluation of the underlying disease. Physical examination revealed marked peripheral edema in both lower extremities. Endoscopic and radiographic examinations confirmed the underlying disease activity. Laboratory tests showed an increase of inflammatory reactants, anemia, hypocalcemia, and severe hypoalbuminemia and hypoproteinemia. He had proteinuria over 24 g/L and creatinine clearance of 66 mL/min, falling within second grade of chronic kidney disease. Renal biopsy was performed for evaluation of renal insufficiency with nephrotic range proteinuria. Congo red staining showed the presence of characteristic amyloid deposition; deposits immunoreacted with the antibody against amyloid A protein, confirming the diagnosis of secondary amyloidosis. The patient was suggested active induction treatment with corticosteroids and azathioprine to achieve remission of Crohn\'s disease, thereafter treatment with infliximab, but he did not consent with this therapy at that time. Studies with infliximab have demonstrated a decrease in SAA circulating levels and proteinuria, as well as stabilization of renal function. Amyloidosis is frequently described as a major cause of death in patients with Crohn\'s disease, with long-term mortality between 40% and 60%. Various therapeutic attempts such as azathioprine, colchicine, dimethyl sulfoxide, infliximab, and elemental diets have been tried but there is no definite treatment for secondary amyloidosis in Crohn\'s disease.

Four cases of idiopathic granulomatous mastitis are reported in this article in order to outline the main clinical features of this affection. Data in the literature were used to discuss diagnostic and therapeutic particularities. The histologic findings of a non-caseating granulomatous inflammation, centered on breast lobules, composed of epithelioid cells and multinucleated giant cells, allow establishing the diagnosis of granulomatous mastitis (GM). The main presenting symptom of GM is a single inflammatory mass of the breast; the diagnosis is thus often mistaken for breast carcinoma (more than 50% of the reported cases). Radiologic and cytologic findings alone do not enable reaching certain diagnosis because they cannot resolve the differential diagnosis of inflammatory process and malignancy. The diagnosis of IGM can be established after the etiological work up remains negative. A course of oral corticosteroid therapy, non-steroidian anti-inflammatory drugs, or colchicine can be used in order to shrink the breast mass, allowing more conservative surgery. Local excision is of limited benefit as there is a strong tendency for recurrence. Different therapeutic options of IGM are explained by its clinical variability.

Between 1988 and 1995, acute abdominal episodes were accompanied by more and more profuse recurrent ascites, partially resolving under colchicine treatment.

Although autophagy induction may limit the development of tumors, evidence in mouse models demonstrates that autophagy inhibition can limit the growth of established tumors and improve response to cancer therapeutics. Certain cancer genotypes may be especially prone to autophagy inhibition. Different strategies for autophagy modulation may be needed depending on the cancer context. Here, we review new advances in the molecular control of autophagy, the role of selective autophagy in cancer, and the role of autophagy within the tumor microenvironment and tumor immunity. We also highlight clinical efforts to repurpose lysosomal inhibitors, such as hydroxychloroquine, as anticancer agents that block autophagy, as well as the development of more potent and specific autophagy inhibitors for cancer treatment, and review future directions for autophagy research. SIGNIFICANCE: Autophagy plays a complex role in cancer, but autophagy inhibition may be an effective therapeutic strategy in advanced cancer. A deeper understanding of autophagy within the tumor microenvironment has enabled the development of novel inhibitors and clinical trial strategies.

DT patients often experience chronic pain, organ dysfunction, decrease in quality of life, and even death. Sorafenib has emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy, which has led to the first randomized phase 3 clinical trial devoted to DTs. Concurrently, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of sorafenib efficacy in a large panel of desmoid cell strains to probe for response mechanism. We found distinctive groups of higher- and lower-responder cells. Clustering the lower-responder group, we observed that CTNNB1 mutation was determinant of outcome. Our results revealed that a lower dose of sorafenib was able to inhibit cell viability, migration, and invasion of wild-type and T41A-mutated DTs. Apoptosis induction was observed in those cells after treatment with sorafenib. On the other hand, the lower dose of sorafenib was not able to inhibit cell viability, migration, or invasion or to induce apoptosis in the S45F-mutated DTs. The investigation of autophagy showed the dependency of S45F-mutated DTs on this pathway as a part of cell survival mechanism. Significantly, when autophagy was inhibited genetically or pharmacologically in the S45F mutant cell strains, sensitivity to sorafenib was restored. Our findings suggest that the response to sorafenib differs when comparing S45F-mutated DTs and T41A-mutated or wild-type DTs. Furthermore, the combination of hydroxychloroquine and sorafenib enhances the antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects in S45F-mutated DT cells, suggesting that profiling \u03b2-catenin status could guide clinical management of desmoid patients who are considering sorafenib treatment.","IncludeStatus":"Exclude","LisedInColA":"No Label","originalFormulation":"No Label","AloneOrComb":"No Label","cancerType":"No Label","studyType":"No Label","therapeuticAssociation":"No Label"},{"id":"204","Drug":"Hydroxychloroquine","PMID":"30489484","Title":"Subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus induced by nivolumab: two case reports and a literature review","Authors":"Zitouni NB, Arnault JP, Dadban A, Attencourt C, Lok CC, Chaby G.","Citation":"Melanoma Res. 2019 Apr;29(2):212-215. doi: 10.1097/CMR.0000000000000536.","CreatedDate":"11/30/18","Abstract":"Nivolumab is widely used to treat several late-stage malignancies such as melanoma and non-small-cell lung cancer by inhibiting the interaction between the programmed cell death protein-1 and its ligand.

Two months after nivolumab discontinuation because of autoimmune hepatitis, the patient was in complete remission and pruritic nummular erythematous plaques appeared on the back and arms. Case 2: a 43-year-old man put under nivolumab for a metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer. After two cycles, an annular erythematous eruption appeared on the hands, arms, and chest.

Lesions were regressive under topical corticosteroids and hydroxychloroquine for the first patient and oral prednisone for the second patient. No systemic involvement was observed. The occurrence of SCLE 2 months after nivolumab discontinuation is evidence that the drug effect is prolonged because of the maintenance of programmed cell death protein-1 reception saturation for months. A causal relationship between SCLE and nivolumab is suggested by (i) the occurrence of SCLE after at least two cycles, (ii) the regression of lesions following treatment with corticosteroids and hydroxychloroquine, and (iii) the fact that it appeared after remission in our first patient.","IncludeStatus":"Exclude","LisedInColA":"No Label","originalFormulation":"No Label","AloneOrComb":"No Label","cancerType":"No Label","studyType":"No Label","therapeuticAssociation":"No Label"},{"id":"205","Drug":"Hydroxychloroquine","PMID":"29290321","Title":"[Kikuchi disease: Evolution during outbreaks and its response to antimalarial treatment]","Authors":"Castro Corredor D, de Lara Sim\u221a\u2265n IM, Bellido Pastrana D.","Citation":"Rev Esp Patol. 2018 Jan-Mar;51(1):34-36. doi: 10.1016/j.patol.2016.09.003.

The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy and tolerance of triple oral DMARD therapy versus anti-TNF agents associated with MTX in patients with RA after MTX failure.

In cancer, its paradoxical dual role of cytoprotection and cytotoxicity is context-dependent and controversial. Autophagy primarily acts as a mechanism of tumour suppression, by maintenance of genomic integrity and prevention of proliferation and inflammation. This, combined with immune-surveillance capabilities and autophagy\'s implicated role in cell death, acts to prevent tumour initiation. However, established tumours exploit autophagy to survive cellular stresses in the hostile tumour microenvironment. This can lead to therapy resistance, one of the biggest challenges facing current anti-cancer approaches. Autophagy modulation is an exciting area of clinical development, attempting to harness this fundamental process as an anti-cancer strategy. Autophagy induction could potentially prevent tumour formation and enhance anti-cancer immune responses. In addition, drug-induced autophagy could be used to kill cancer cells, particularly those in which the apoptotic machinery is defective. Conversely, autophagy inhibition may help to sensitise resistant cancer cells to conventional chemotherapies and specifically target autophagy-addicted tumours. Currently, hydroxychloroquine is in phase I and II clinical trials in combination with several standard chemotherapies, whereas direct, deliberate autophagy induction remains to be tested clinically. More comprehensive understanding of the roles of autophagy throughout different stages of carcinogenesis has potential to guide development of novel therapeutic strategies to eradicate cancer cells.","IncludeStatus":"Exclude","LisedInColA":"No Label","originalFormulation":"No Label","AloneOrComb":"No Label","cancerType":"No Label","studyType":"No Label","therapeuticAssociation":"No Label"},{"id":"209","Drug":"Hydroxychloroquine","PMID":"32368072","Title":"Refractory Sarcoidosis: A Review","Authors":"El Jammal T, Jamilloux Y, Gerfaud-Valentin M, Valeyre D, S\u221a\xaeve P.","Citation":"Ther Clin Risk Manag. 2020 Apr 17;16:323-345. doi: 10.2147/TCRM.S192922. eCollection 2020.","CreatedDate":"5/6/20","Abstract":"Sarcoidosis is a multi-system disease of unknown etiology characterized by granuloma formation in various organs (especially lung and mediastinohilar lymph nodes). In more than half of patients, the disease resolves spontaneously. When indicated, it usually responds to corticosteroids, the first-line treatment, but some patients may not respond or tolerate them. An absence of treatment response is rare and urges for verifying the absence of a diagnosis error, the good adherence of the treatment, the presence of active lesions susceptible to respond since fibrotic lesions are irreversible. That is when second-line treatments, immunosuppressants (methotrexate, leflunomide, azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, hydroxychloroquine), should be considered. Methotrexate is the only first-line immunosuppressant validated by a randomized controlled trial. Refractory sarcoidosis is not yet a well-defined condition, but it remains a real challenge for the physicians. Herein, we considered refractory sarcoidosis as\xa0a disease in which second-line treatments are not sufficient to achieve satisfying disease control or satisfying corticosteroids tapering. Tumor necrosis alpha inhibitors, third-line treatments, have been validated through randomized controlled trials. There are currently no guidelines or recommendations regarding refractory sarcoidosis. Moreover, criteria defining non-response to treatment need to be clearly specified. The delay to achieve response to organ involvement and drugs also should be defined. In the past ten years, the efficacy of several immunosuppressants beforehand used in other autoimmune or inflammatory diseases was reported in refractory cases series. Among them, anti-CD20 antibodies (rituximab), repository corticotrophin injection, and anti-JAK therapy anti-interleukin-6 receptor monoclonal antibody (tocilizumab) were the main reported. Unfortunately, no clinical trial is available to validate their use in the case of sarcoidosis. Currently, other immunosuppressants such as JAK inhibitors are on trial to assess their efficacy in sarcoidosis. In this review, we propose to summarize the state of the art regarding the use of immunosuppressants and their management in the case of refractory or multidrug-resistant sarcoidosis.","IncludeStatus":"Exclude","LisedInColA":"No Label","originalFormulation":"No Label","AloneOrComb":"No Label","cancerType":"No Label","studyType":"No Label","therapeuticAssociation":"No Label"},{"id":"210","Drug":"Hydroxychloroquine","PMID":"23588939","Title":"Clinical response within 12 weeks as a predictor of future low disease activity in patients with early RA: results from the TEAR Trial","Authors":"Curtis JR, McVie T, Mikuls TR, Reynolds RJ, Navarro-Mill\u221a\xb0n I, O\'Dell J, Moreland LW, Bridges SL Jr, Ranganath VK, Cofield SS.","Citation":"J Rheumatol. 2013 May;40(5):572-8. doi: 10.3899/jrheum.120715.

Here we report the 2 year follow-up assessment. In this randomised, non-blinded, parallel-group trial, we enrolled adult patients older than 18 years with rheumatoid arthritis and a symptom duration of less than 1 year from 15 rheumatology units in Sweden between December, 2002 and December, 2006. All patients were started on methotrexate. After 3-4 months, those who failed treatment were randomly assigned (1:1) to group A (conventional treatment; additional sulfasalazine and hydroxychloroquine) or group B (biological treatment; additional infliximab). Randomisation was done with a computer-generated sequence. We analysed clinical outcomes at months 18 and 24 by the response criteria of the American College of Rheumatology and the European League Against Rheumatism, and radiographs of patients\' hands and feet at months 12 and 24 using the Van der Heijde modification of the Sharp score. Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered with www.ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00764725. Of 493 screened individuals, we enrolled 487, of whom 258 were randomly allocated to treatment. The proportion of patients in group B who received a EULAR-defined good response was non-significantly greater than it was in group A at 18 months (49 of 128 [38%] vs 38 of 130 [29%]) and at 24 months (49 of 128 [38%] vs 40 of 130 [31%]; p=0\xb7204). After 24 months, radiological disease progression was greater in patients in group A than it was in those in group B (mean 7\xb723 [SD 12\xb772] vs 4\xb700 [10\xb70]; p=0\xb7009). We recorded three serious adverse events: an extended generalised illness in group A, an extended febrile episode in group B, and a generalised illness in group B. Additional biological treatment is a valid option for patients who fail initial methotrexate treatment. However, improved clinical outcomes after 12 months and better radiographical results after 24 months should be weighed against the absence of a convincing clinical difference at 24 months and substantially higher costs. Therefore, for many patients who fail initial methotrexate treatment, add-on treatment with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs is an appropriate treatment option.

She had no abnormalities in serum cholesterol or triglycerides levels. A detailed laboratory analysis revealed the presence of mild monoclonal gammopathy with a presence of immunoglobulin G (IgG) kappa light chains; however, according to hematologist consultation, it did not require medical intervention. Imaging assessment and ultrasound examination did not show any specific involvement of internal organs. The skin biopsy demonstrated necrobiotic areas alternated with foci of xanthogranulomatous infiltration throughout the reticular dermis with extension into subcutaneous tissue. The granulomatous infiltrate was composed of epithelioid, foamy histiocytes in addition to conspicuous giant cells of the Touton type and foreign body type, as well as variable numbers of lymphocytes, plasma cells, and neutrophiles. Lipid vacuoles were seen within the foci of necrobiosis and xanthogranulomatous infiltration (Figure 2). Two months after first admission to our department, the first signs of necrosis within the lesions were noted, and massive necrosis of skin lesions occurred after the following 5 months (Figure 1). Based on the clinical manifestation and histological and laboratory findings, the diagnosis of necrobiotic xanthogranuloma (NXG) was established. In our patient, the extremely late onset of the disease, its very aggressive course, and the absence of malignant hematological disorder were remarkable. The general condition improved after local treatment and a low dose of prednisone. However, patient anamnesis revealed myocardial infarction in the past, congestive heart failure, and atrial fibrillation. Eventually, the patient died due to acute heart failure before alkylating agents could be administered; we consider the patient\'s death to have been unrelated to NXG. NXG is a rare, chronic granulomatous disorder which was first described in 1980 by Kossard and Winkelmann (1). Currently, less than one hundred fifty cases of this syndrome have been reported in the literature worldwide (2,3). The disease occurs during adulthood, slightly more frequently in women, and usually after the age of 60 years, although the youngest reported patient was 17 years old (3). The disease initially manifests as xanthoma-like eruptions of yellowish or red-orange papules and nodules that coalesce into indurated plaques (4). The size of the lesions typically increases over time or with the next recurrences. In comparison to hyperlipemic and normolipemic xanthomas, the lesions are firmer, more prominent, and more polymorphic (3) with superficial telangiectasias, sometimes erythematous and/or violaceous borders, and atrophy (5). Ulcerations of the lesions were observed in about 50% of patients and tended to be extensive and progressive (4). Skin lesions of NXG can occur anywhere on the body. However, about two-thirds of patients had periorbital involvement, particularly on the upper and/or lower eyelids or elsewhere on the face. The second most commonly affected site was the trunk, predominantly the chest (3-6). However, many skin lesions first appear on the trunk or extremities and subsequently involve the periorbital area (4). More than one body area was affected in about 90% of the published cases (3,4). In individual cases, the occurrence of NXG was noted within scars, after trauma, or in a previously X-ray irradiated area (5). Lesions may be asymptomatic; however, over half of patients asked reported various symptoms, predominantly itching but also burning, tenderness, and even pain (4,5). Periorbital skin lesions are often accompanied by ophthalmic manifestations, mainly scleritis, choroiditis, or conjunctivitis (3), and with complications such as blepharoptosis, restricted ocular motility, and proptosis (4,5). Extracutaneous lesions are most commonly seen in the respiratory tract, including the lungs and larynx, followed by the myocardium, oral cavity, skeletal muscles, kidneys, ovaries, intestine, and other sites (5,6). Extracutaneous involvement was reported in less than 20% of cases (3), but its frequency seems to have increased in recent years (5). Regarding laboratory abnormalities, the majority of patients with NXG (70% and up to 90% depending on the studied population) have a monoclonal gammopathy (more often IgG-kappa than IgG-lambda). Elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, anemia, leukopenia, low C1 and C4 levels, and cryoglobulinemia are also frequently present (3-6). Incisional biopsy is recommended to confirm the diagnosis of NXG, but correlations between the clinical presentation and specific histopathologic findings have been poorly characterized so far. The histopathology shows an inflammatory infiltrate composed of macrophages, foam cells, plasma cells, and other inflammatory cells as well as Touton and foreign body-type giant cells in the dermis and subcutaneous tissue. Necrobiosis is usually present, and nodular lymphoid aggregates are common. Cholesterol clefts or asteroid bodies are rare or absent. The epidermis may be atrophic or normal. Special stains are not helpful in establishing the diagnosis of NXG, but immunohistochemistry for CD68 is positive while it is always for CD1a and PS100 negative, like in non-X histiocytosis (4,5). In patients without a known myeloproliferative disorder, bone marrow biopsy may reveal atypical or increased plasma cells and, very rarely, true multiple myeloma (5). As mentioned above, NXG can be a manifestation of multiple myeloma. However, chronic lymphocyte leukemia, B-cell lymphoma, and other lymphoproliferative diseases have also been reported in patients with NXG (3). Remarkably, hematological disorders may emerge many years before or after the onset of skin lesions (even up to 11 years) (4). According to available literature data, the course of the disease is usually chronic and slowly progressive, and the prognosis is relatively good in the absence of co-occurrence of malignant hematological disorders ([5-7). Aside from hyperlipemic and normolipemic xanthomas, the differential diagnosis of NXG includes multifocal necrobiosis lipoidica, granuloma annulare, foreign-body granuloma, juvenile xanthogranuloma, rheumatoid nodules, and amyloidosis (4). In 5 cases from the literature, xanthoma and NXG were present at the same time (3). Despite several hypotheses, the etiopathogenesis of NXG remains unknown (3,4,8). For that reason and due to the rarity of the disease, the optimal therapy has not been not defined. Frequently, chlorambucil or melphalan have been used alone or in combination with prednisone (4). Treatment may result in remission of symptoms on the skin, but it does not provide a permanent cure (8). There are also single reports of the successful use of thalidomide, lenalidomide, cyclophosphamide, dexamethasone, interferon 2a and 2b, plasmapheresis and hydroxychloroquine, azathioprine, infliximab, and autologous bone marrow transplantation (3). Methotrexate seems to be ineffective (9). Local therapy, including local steroids, laser CO2, or radiotherapy, results in partial improvement (3,4). Skin lesions which relapsed or were unresponsive to treatment could be excised surgically and the defects resurfaced with skin grafts.

When the breast is involved, the term lupus mastitis (LM) is used. This disease involving the breast is rare, and the lesions may precede, coincide with, or occur later than the onset of other lupus lesions. Tissue biopsy is required to confirm the suspected diagnoses of LM. We report a case of a patient with lupus mastitis due to the important differential diagnosis. A 60-year-old woman presented with a painful nodular lesion in her left breast that had appeared 15 days ago (Figure 1, a). She had been previously diagnosed with discoid lupus erythematosus 3 years ago. Physical examination revealed a deep and firm erythematous subcutaneous nodule without overlying skin involvement in the lower-central portion of the left breast. Laboratory findings were positive for antinuclear antibodies (1:80) and double-stranded deoxynucleic acid antibodies (1:10). Mammography and ultrasounds showed an area of increased density and irregular breast tissue along with an important thickening of the overlying skin (Figure 1, b). On suspicion of malignancy, a needle biopsy of the breast lesion was performed and showed vacuolar alteration and lymphocytic infiltrate in the basal layer. Subcutaneous fat showed a lobular panniculitis with a prominent lymphocytic infiltrate and hyalinization of the fat lobules (hyaline fat necrosis). Direct immunofluorescence of the face biopsy revealed IgA, IgG, IgM, and C3 granular deposition. Based on these results, a diagnosis of lupus mastitis associated with DLE was established. Antimalarial therapy resulted in complete resolution of the clinical features. Three years later, the patient presented with a disfiguring atrophy with retraction in the damaged areas of the breast (Figure 2). Lupus mastitis is a very unusual disease that most commonly affects middle-aged women. The first case of LM was described by Tuffanelli in 1971. The lesions usually present following the diagnosis of SLE/DLE; however, on rare occasions they may be observed earlier (2). The histophysiology of this disease remains unclear, but the predominant theory suggests an autoimmune-related etiology. Corroborating evidence for this theory includes the finding of immune complexes, both at the basement membrane of the dermal-epidermal junction and in the blood vessels in the areas of panniculitis (3). Lupus mastitis may be present in the breast as single or multiple subcutaneous nodules that may be tender or painful and can progress to chronic ulcers over time or resolve, leaving atrophic scars. The overlying skin can be normal, erythematous, poikilodermic or ulcerated. When skin changes are prominent, the lesion may clinically and radiologically mimic inflammatory breast carcinoma. Mammographic and ultrasounds findings include an ill-defined breast density with or without associated microcalcifications (4). Histologically, this disease is characterized by lobular lymphocytic panniculitis and predominantly involves the fat lobule and the presence of anucleated adipocytes in a background of a glassy-appearing collagenous stroma (hyaline fat necrosis). Fibrinoid necrosis of the vessel wall has also been reported, but is usually absent (5). Differential diagnosis of lupus mastitis includes inflammatory breast carcinoma, primary medullary carcinoma, and other immune-mediated inflammatory conditions such as diabetic mastopathy. The first line of treatment the use of antimalarial drugs such as hydroxychloroquine. Systemic steroids and cyclophosphamide have also been used. Surgical treatment should be considered only in patients who do not respond to management with medications. In summary, we reported a case of lupus mastitis in a patient with discoid lupus erythematosus. This dermatosis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of breast lesions in lupus patients, and a biopsy of the breast lesion is essential to reject suspected malignancy. If the disease is left untreated, unsightly atrophy will appear; it is thus important to diagnose early on. The course of the disease tends to be chronic with remission and flares, so patients should be followed-up regularly due to the risk of recurrences in the same area or in a different location.","IncludeStatus":"Exclude","LisedInColA":"No Label","originalFormulation":"No Label","AloneOrComb":"No Label","cancerType":"No Label","studyType":"No Label","therapeuticAssociation":"No Label"},{"id":"221","Drug":"Hydroxychloroquine","PMID":"25274900","Title":"Patients with rheumatoid arthritis in clinical remission manifest persistent joint inflammation on histology and imaging studies","Authors":"Anandarajah A, Thiele R, Giampoli E, Monu J, Seo GS, Feng C, Ritchlin CT.","Citation":"J Rheumatol. 2014 Nov;41(11):2153-60. doi: 10.3899/jrheum.140411.

The reduction in TIA was greatest in males who were normotensive and when there was an angiographically demonstrated lesion in the carotid artery that accounted for the symptoms. Aspirin reduced venous thrombosis and non-fatal and fatal pulmonary embolism in patients after surgery for fractured hip and after elective hip replacement. There is evidence that the prophylactic effect of aspirin may be greater in male patients. Aspirin reduced the frequency of arteriovenous shunt thrombosis. Aspirin abolished symptoms in patients with peripheral ischemia associated with thrombocytosis and spontaneous platelet aggregation. There is no conclusive evidence at the present time that aspirin is effective in patients with coronary artery artery disease.

Twenty-two patients with MDS (median age, 77.5 yr [interquartile range, 69-81]; 10 women) were included. Inflammatory arthritis presented as polyarthritis in 17 cases (77%) and with symmetric involvement in 15 cases (68%). At diagnosis, the median disease activity score 28 based on C-reactive protein (DAS28-CRP) was 4.5 [2-6.5]. Two patients had anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPAs), and 1 had radiologic erosions. The median time between the diagnoses of arthritis and MDS was 10 months [6-42], with a median articular symptom duration of 3 months [2-8]. The diagnosis of both diseases was concomitant in 6 cases (27%); arthritis preceded MDS in 12 cases (55%), and occurred after MDS in 4 (18%). While the number of swollen and tender joints significantly decreased during follow-up, as did the median DAS28-CRP (from 4.3 [3.8-4.6] at baseline to 2.9 [1.75-3.3]; p < 0.05), CRP remained elevated (CRP >20 mg/L) in 8 patients (42%). Nevertheless, radiographic progression and new ACPA positivity were not observed during a median follow-up of 29 months [9-76]. While most of the patients were treated with steroids (n = 16) for arthritis, additional treatment was administered in only 4 patients (hydroxychloroquine, n = 2; sulfasalazine [Salazopyrin] and etanercept, n = 1, respectively). Eleven patients died during follow-up from acute myeloid leukemia (n = 5); infections (n = 3); or cerebral bleeding, cardiorespiratory failure, or undetermined cause (n = 1, respectively). Inflammatory arthritis associated with MDS can have various presentations and is often seronegative and nonerosive. Steroids alone are the most common treatment in MDS-associated arthritis, but that treatment is insufficient to control arthritis. Steroid-sparing strategies need to be identified.","IncludeStatus":"Exclude","LisedInColA":"No Label","originalFormulation":"No Label","AloneOrComb":"No Label","cancerType":"No Label","studyType":"No Label","therapeuticAssociation":"No Label"},{"id":"226","Drug":"Hydroxychloroquine","PMID":"23968145","Title":"A case of idiopathic follicular mucinosis treated with bexarotene gel","Authors":"Heyl J, Mehregan D, Kado J, Campbell M.","Citation":"Int J Dermatol. 2014 Jul;53(7):838-41. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-4632.2012.05789.x.

To determine the effect of add-on Quinacrine (Qn) treatment on serum BAFF levels and the effect of this treatment on SLE disease activity index (SLEDAI), antidsDNA and anticardiolipin (aCL) antibody levels, we treated 29 stable SLE patients, who were maintained on prednisolone and hydroxychloroquine and in some on azathioprine (AZT), with additional Qn (100 mg/d) with an aim to further reduce disease activity. SLEDAI, antidsDNA, aCL antibodies and serum BAFF levels were assessed before and 3 months after the addition of Qn. Three months following Qn initiation, a reduction in SLEDAI was noticed in 19/29 patients (mean 8.8 +/- 2.3 to 3.3 +/- 1.5, P = 0.009), followed by reduction or discontinuation of prednisolone in all patients and the discontinuation of AZT in five patients. Serum BAFF levels were significantly reduced in 8/12 patients (mean 6.3 +/- 0.5 to 3.0 +/- 0.56 ng/ml P = 0.0001). This reduction was found in correlation with a decrease in aCL titres. However, the decrease in SLEDAI scores and antidsDNA antibody titres was unrelated to the decrease in serum BAFF or aCL levels. We conclude that the addition of Qn to previous therapeutic regimens in active SLE is beneficial and seems to reduce SLEDAI scores, serum BAFF and aCL levels and therefore should be considered in many of our SLE patients before aggressive treatments are given.","IncludeStatus":"Exclude","LisedInColA":"No Label","originalFormulation":"No Label","AloneOrComb":"No Label","cancerType":"No Label","studyType":"No Label","therapeuticAssociation":"No Label"},{"id":"228","Drug":"Hydroxychloroquine","PMID":"22285690","Title":"Q fever osteomyelitis: a case report and literature review","Authors":"Merhej V, Tattevin P, Revest M, Le Touvet B, Raoult D.","Citation":"Comp Immunol Microbiol Infect Dis. 2012 Mar;35(2):169-72. doi: 10.1016/j.cimid.2011.12.008.

This medication (Mabthera) is indicated in the treatment of relapsing or refractory follicular lymphoma. A 31-year-old North African woman had been treated for 10 years with prednisone, hydroxychloroquine, methotrexate and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for systemic lupus erythematosus. She presented severe immune thrombocytopenic purpura (platelet count: 4G/l) 3 months after initiation of antitubercular treatment for multisystem tuberculosis. The patient was unsuccessfully treated at the outset with 3 infusions of intravenous immunoglobulin. Since thrombocytopenia remained under 5 G/l, she was given rituximab 375 mg/m2/week for 4 weeks. Thrombocytopenia and native anti-DNA antibody levels decreased after the third infusion (D16). No side effects of treatment were observed. The patient did not experience any relapse during the 29 months following the final infusion. In the present case, rituximab was used because of multisystem tuberculosis.

We compared boosted protease inhibitor monotherapy with dual therapy with boosted protease inhibitor plus lamivudine in patients on second-line antiretrovial therapy (ART). We did a multicentre, randomised, parallel, open-label, superiority, trial in the HIV services of five hospitals in sub-Saharan Africa (Yaound\xe9, Cameroon; Dakar, Senegal; and Bobo Dioulasso, Burkina Faso). We recruited patients from the long-term, post-trial cohort of the ANRS 12169/2LADY study that compared the efficacy of three second-line combinations based on boosted protease inhibitors. Participants for our study were HIV-1 infected with multiple mutations including M184V, at first-line failure, aged 18 years and older, on boosted protease inhibitor plus two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) for at least 48 weeks with at least 48 weeks follow-up in the 2LADY trial, with two viral load measurements of less than 200 copies per mL in the previous 6 months, CD4 counts of more than 100 cells per \u03bcL, adherence of at least 90%, and no change to ART in the past 3 months. We randomly assigned participants (1:1) to receive either monotherapy with their boosted protease inhibitor (once-daily darunavir 800 mg [two 400 mg tablets] boosted with ritonavir 100 mg [one tablet] or coformulation of lopinavir 200 mg with ritonavir 50 mg [two tablets taken twice per day]) or to boosted protease inhibitor plus once-daily lamivudine 300 mg (one 300 mg tablet or two 150 mg tablets). Computer-generated randomisation was stratified by study site and viral load at screening (< 50 copies per mL, and 50-200 copies per mL), and concealed from study personnel throughout the inclusion period. After randomisation, treatment allocation was not masked from clinicians or patients]. Patients had follow-up visits at weeks 4 and 12, and every 3 months until 96 weeks; if viral load exceeded 500 copies per mL at any visit, NRTI (tenofovir and lamivudine) were reintroduced into treatment. The primary outcome was the proportion of participants who had treatment failure at 96 weeks in the intention-to-treat analysis, where treatment failure was defined as one of the following: a confirmed viral load of more than 500 copies per mL, reintroduction of NRTI, or interruption of boosted protease inhibitor. We designed the study to detect a difference of 12% between groups in the primary outcome, with an expected 20% of patients having treatment failure in the monotherapy group. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01905059. Between March 5, 2014, and Jan 26, 2015, 265 participants were assigned to receive monotherapy (133) or boosted protease inhibitor plus lamivudine (132). At week 48, an independent data safety monitoring board reviewed data, and advised discontinuation of the monotherapy group because the number of failures had exceeded the expected 20%; therefore results here are for week 48. At this point, treatment failure occurred in four (3\xb70%; 95% CI 0\xb78-7\xb76) of 132 participants on dual therapy and 33 (24\xb78%; 17\xb77-33\xb70) of 133 participants on monotherapy (relative risk 8\xb72, 95% CI 3\xb70-22\xb75; odds ratio 10\xb76, 95% CI 3\xb76-42\xb71). The difference between groups (21\xb78%, 95% CI 13\xb79-29\xb77; p<0\xb70001) showed superiority of dual therapy compared with monotherapy. We recorded 46 severe adverse events of grade 3 or 4 (29 in the monotherapy group, 17 in the boosted protease inhibitor plus lamivudine group); one event in the montherapy group (intoxication resulting from co-administration of ritonavir-boosted lopinavir with an ergotamine derivate) was deemed related to study drug. Two participants in the monotherapy group and one in the dual therapy group died, all from causes not related to study drugs or procedures (one from complications from gastric cancer surgery, one in a work accident, and one from a lung disease of unknown cause). After viral suppression with boosted protease inhibitor plus NRTI in second-line ART, maintenance therapy with boosted protease inhibitor plus lamivudine was associated with a high rate of success, despite the presence of M184V mutations at first-line treatment failure. Results indicated that boosted protease inhibitor monotherapy cannot be recommended for these patients.

Colposcopy, HPV testing and LBC were repeated at 4 and 12 weeks post-start of treatment with a final punch biopsy at 3 months for histology. Primary outcome measures were acceptability of treatment with efficacy as a secondary consideration. A total of 23 women with HSIL were treated with Lopimune during which time no adverse reactions were reported. A maximum concentration of 10 ng/ml of lopinavir was detected in patient plasma 1 week after starting treatment. HPV was no longer detected in 12/23 (52.2%, 95%CI: 30.6-73.2%).

These data are supported by colposcopic images, which show regression of cervical lesions. These results demonstrate the potential of Lopimune as a self-applied therapy for HPV infection and related cervical lesions. Since there were no serious adverse events or detectable post-treatment morbidity, this study indicates that further trials are clearly justified to define optimal regimes and the overall benefit of this therapy.

To evaluate the margin-negative (R0) resection rate of neoadjuvant FOLFIRINOX (fluorouracil, leucovorin, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan) and losartan followed by chemoradiotherapy for locally advanced pancreatic cancer. A single-arm phase 2 clinical trial was conducted at a large academic hospital from August 22, 2013, to May 22, 2018, among 49 patients with previously untreated locally advanced unresectable pancreatic cancer as determined by multidisciplinary review. Patients had Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0 or 1 and adequate hematologic, renal, and hepatic function. Median follow-up for the analysis was 17.1 months (range, 5.0-53.7) among 27 patients still alive at study completion. Patients received FOLFIRINOX and losartan for 8 cycles. Patients with radiographically resectable tumor after chemotherapy received short-course chemoradiotherapy (5 GyE\u2009\xd7\u20095 with protons) with capecitabine.

Of the 49 patients (26 women and 23 men; median age 63 years [range, 42-78 years]), 39 completed 8 cycles of FOLFIRINOX and losartan; 10 patients had fewer than 8 cycles due to progression (5 patients), losartan intolerance (3 patients), and toxicity (2 patients). Seven patients (16%) had short-course chemoradiotherapy while 38 (84%) had long-course chemoradiotherapy. Forty-two (86%) patients underwent attempted surgery, with R0 resection achieved in 34 of 49 patients (69%; 95% CI, 55%-82%).

More and more data are in favour of the claim that commonly used antihypertensive drugs also contain the risk of developing melanoma. The most evidence is that angiotensin receptor blockers may be carcinogenic. Two representatives from this group, valsartan and irbesartan, produced by certain pharmaceutical companies are being withdrawn from the market due to finding content of NDMA and NDEA, which are believed to be potent carcinogens. Another representative of this group, losartan, according to in vitro data, potentiates cell adhesion and invasion of human melanoma cells. We present a 45-year-old man with arterial hypertension. For year and a half/two years, the patient is on systemic therapy with Aspirin and Irbesartan/Hydrochlorothiazide. The patient also reported about the presence of a pigmented lesion in the abdominal area, which occurred 5-6 years ago, before the onset of cardiac therapy. According to him, there was a change in the colour and size of the lesion within the framework of cardiac therapy (from 1.5-2 years). Innovative one step melanoma surgery was performed, and the lesion was radically removed with a 1 cm operational safety margin in all directions within one operative session. The subsequent histological verification found the presence of thin melanoma. Drug-induced melanoma turned out to be a problem of significant importance. The group of angiotensin receptor blockers should be investigated more thoroughly and in detail on the probability of potentiating carcinogenesis. We describe an interesting case showing the progression of pigment lesion to melanoma as a possible result of irbesartan therapy, i.e. we share a theory that differs from that of drug-induced de novo melanomas. It should not be overlooked the fact that another widely used drug-Aspirin, is also likely to potentiate the development of melanoma. Furthermore, the case is indicative of the use of one step melanoma surgery in a melanoma patient with a thickness less than 1 mm.","IncludeStatus":"Exclude","LisedInColA":"No Label","originalFormulation":"No Label","AloneOrComb":"No Label","cancerType":"No Label","studyType":"No Label","therapeuticAssociation":"No Label"},{"id":"242","Drug":"Losartan","PMID":"30607196","Title":"Valsartan Induced Melanoma?!

According to the literature, dopamine agonists and acetylsalicylic acid fall into the list of drugs likely to potentiate the development of cutaneous melanoma. However, according to recent data, widely used angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) for the treatment of arterial hypertension, also carry a risk of malignancy development. The content of probable carcinogens, such as NDMA or NDEA in the drug valsartan (ARBs), causes the product to be withdrawn from the market. Recent experimental data suggest that another angiotensin receptor blocker-losartan also stimulates cell adhesion and melanoma cell invasion. We present a 70-year-old patient who has been on systemic therapy with a combined drug of amlodipine and valsartan since 2008 and only valsartan from 2015. Three years after the first intake of valsartan (2011), the patient developed a pigment lesion on the right arm. Approximately 2.5 years after doubling the dose of valsartan, the patient observed a progression in the size of the lesion, which was the cause of the dermatological examination and hospitalisation for surgical removal. The melanocytic lesion was removed by radical excision and a surgical field of 0.5 cm in all directions, followed by histological verification, which found the presence of cutaneous melanoma with a tumour thickness of 3 mm. A re-excision was planned with an additional surgical field of 1.5 cm in all directions combined with parallel removal of a draining lymph node. The case is indicative of two things: 1) the possible triggering of melanoma within the systemic treatment with valsartan; and 2) the necessity for optimization of melanoma surgery within the one-step melanoma surgery, which in this case would result in a single surgical excision of the primary lesion, with an operational security field of 2 cm in all directions, along with the removal of a draining lymph node.","IncludeStatus":"Exclude","LisedInColA":"No Label","originalFormulation":"No Label","AloneOrComb":"No Label","cancerType":"No Label","studyType":"No Label","therapeuticAssociation":"No Label"},{"id":"243","Drug":"Losartan","PMID":"25223563","Title":"An FDA overview of rodent carcinogenicity studies of angiotensin II AT-1 receptor blockers: pulmonary adenomas and carcinomas","Authors":"Link WT, De Felice A.","Citation":"Regul Toxicol Pharmacol. 2014 Nov;70(2):555-63. doi: 10.1016/j.yrtph.2014.09.002.

It revealed excess new lung cancer diagnoses in the cohorts treated with an ARB and background therapy (0.9% vs. 0.7% in non-ARB control; RR: 1.25; CI: 1.05-1.49; p=0.01). The FDA responded with a larger meta-analysis of 31 clinical trials (n=155,816) of ARBs that found no evidence of any excess of site-specific cancer (lung, breast, prostate), solid/skin cancer or cancer death (FDA safety communication, 3 June 2011). The FDA then re-visited the 19 rodent carcinogenicity assays of 9 ARBs, starting with those for Losartan in 1994, for any evidence of dosage-related lung tumorigenicity in this class. Assays were performed in 5 strains of rats and 5 strains of wild-type and transgenic mice per protocols and dosages sanctioned by FDA\'s executive carcinogenicity assessment committee (eCAC). Duration was lifetime except for 26-week assays of azilsartan and olmesartan in transgenic Tg rasH2 mice, and an assay of olmesartan in p53(+/-) transgenic mice. The dosages provided exposures approximating, and in most cases up to 20-300times greater than, that in patients. Depending on strain, up to 35% of untreated mice spontaneously developed lung tumors. Regression analysis of placebo-corrected mouse lung tumor incidence collapsed across strains, gender, and ARBs vs. multiples of human exposure revealed no excess lung neoplasia. The R(2) of <0.001 reflected the virtually identical number of treated cohorts with more tumors than its control cohort vs. those with less. Regardless of strain, both control and medicated rats were essentially devoid of lung tumors in the lifetime trials. Accordingly, there was neither promotion of background lung tumors in the mouse, nor initiation of de novo lung tumors in the rat. The negative lung findings in the mouse Tg rasH2 strain are also noteworthy given that, historically, the most prevalent spontaneous tumors in 26week trials in that model are lung adenomas and carcinomas. The negative results of the 19, mostly lifetime, assays for cancer viewed en masse add to the results of the meta-analysis of the shorter clinical trials of ARBs that were benign regardless of statistical method used (random vs. fixed effect), comparator arm (with or without ACE-inhibitors) and major co-factors (smoking or cancer history).

The benefit of its drug treatment to prevent major cardiovascular events was consistently demonstrated. Angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARB) have been the preferential drugs in the management of hypertension worldwide, despite the absence of any consistent evidence of advantage over older agents, and the concern that they may be associated with lower renal protection and risk for cancer. Diuretics are as efficacious as other agents, are well tolerated, have longer duration of action and low cost, but have been scarcely compared with ARBs. A study comparing diuretic and ARB is therefore warranted. This is a randomized, double-blind, clinical trial, comparing the association of chlorthalidone and amiloride with losartan as first drug option in patients aged 30 to 70 years, with stage I hypertension. The primary outcomes will be variation of blood pressure by time, adverse events and development or worsening of microalbuminuria and of left ventricular hypertrophy in the EKG. The secondary outcomes will be fatal or non-fatal cardiovascular events: myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure, evidence of new subclinical atherosclerosis and sudden death. The study will last 18 months. The sample size will be of 1200 participants for group in order to confer enough power to test for all primary outcomes. The project was approved by the Ethics committee of each participating institution. The putative pleiotropic effects of ARB agents, particularly renal protection, have been disputed, and they have been scarcely compared with diuretics in large clinical trials, despite that they have been at least as efficacious as newer agents in managing hypertension.

We investigated whether the regimen of gemcitabine, cisplatin, and methylprednisolone (GEM-P) was superior to CHOP as front-line therapy in previously untreated patients. We did a phase 2, parallel-group, multicentre, open-label randomised trial in 47 hospitals: 46 in the UK and one in Australia. Participants were patients aged 18 years and older with bulky (tumour mass diameter >10 cm) stage I to stage IV disease (WHO performance status 0-3), previously untreated peripheral T-cell lymphoma not otherwise specified, angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma, anaplastic lymphoma kinase-negative anaplastic large cell lymphoma, enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma, or hepatosplenic \u03b3\u03b4 T-cell lymphoma. We randomly assigned patients (1:1) stratified by subtype of peripheral T-cell lymphoma and international prognostic index to either CHOP (intravenous cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m<sup>2</sup>, doxorubicin 50 mg/m<sup>2</sup>, and vincristine 1\xb74 mg/m<sup>2</sup> [maximum 2 mg] on day 1, and oral prednisolone 100 mg on days 1-5) every 21 days for six cycles; or GEM-P (intravenous gemcitabine 1000 mg/m<sup>2</sup> on days 1, 8, and 15, cisplatin 100 mg/m<sup>2</sup> on day 15, and oral or intravenous methylprednisolone 1000 mg on days 1-5) every 28 days for four cycles. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with a CT-based complete response or unconfirmed complete response on completion of study chemotherapy, to detect a 20% superiority of GEM-P compared with CHOP, assessed in all patients who received at least one cycle of treatment and had an end-of-treatment CT scan or reported clinical progression as the reason for stopping trial treatment. Safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of study medication. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01719835) and the European Clinical Trials Database (EudraCT 2011-004146-18). Between June 18, 2012, and Nov 16, 2016, we randomly assigned 87 patients to treatment, 43 to CHOP and 44 to GEM-P. A planned unmasked review of efficacy data by the independent data monitoring committee in November, 2016, showed that the number of patients with a confirmed or unconfirmed complete response with GEM-P was non-significantly inferior compared with CHOP and the trial was closed early. At a median follow-up of 27\xb74 months (IQR 16\xb76-38\xb74), 23 patients (62%) of 37 assessable patients assigned to CHOP had achieved a complete response or unconfirmed complete response compared with 17 (46%) of 37 assigned to GEM-P (odds ratio 0\xb752, 95% CI 0\xb721-1\xb731; p=0\xb7164). The most common adverse events of grade 3 or worse in both groups were neutropenia (17 [40%] with CHOP and nine [20%] with GEM-P), thrombocytopenia (4 [10%] with CHOP and 13 [30%] with GEM-P, and febrile neutropenia (12 [29%] with CHOP and 3 [7%] with GEM-P). Two patients (5%) died during the study, both in the GEM-P group, from lung infections. The number of patients with a complete response or unconfirmed complete response did not differ between the groups, indicating that GEM-P was not superior for this outcome. CHOP should therefore remain the reference regimen for previously untreated peripheral T-cell lymphoma.

Here, we test haploidentical, related-donor NK-cell infusions in a nontransplantation setting to determine safety and in vivo NK-cell expansion. Two lower intensity outpatient immune suppressive regimens were tested: (1) low-dose cyclophosphamide and methylprednisolone and (2) fludarabine. A higher intensity inpatient regimen of high-dose cyclophosphamide and fludarabine (Hi-Cy/Flu) was tested in patients with poor-prognosis acute myeloid leukemia (AML). All patients received subcutaneous interleukin 2 (IL-2) after infusions. Patients who received lower intensity regimens showed transient persistence but no in vivo expansion of donor cells. In contrast, infusions after the more intense Hi-Cy/Flu resulted in a marked rise in endogenous IL-15, expansion of donor NK cells, and induction of complete hematologic remission in 5 of 19 poor-prognosis patients with AML. These findings suggest that haploidentical NK cells can persist and expand in vivo and may have a role in the treatment of selected malignancies used alone or as an adjunct to HCT.","IncludeStatus":"Exclude","LisedInColA":"No Label","originalFormulation":"No Label","AloneOrComb":"No Label","cancerType":"No Label","studyType":"No Label","therapeuticAssociation":"No Label"},{"id":"253","Drug":"Methylprednisolone","PMID":"31917421","Title":"A prophylaxis study of acute exacerbation of interstitial pneumonia after lung cancer surgery","Authors":"Ito H, Nakayama H, Yokose T, Nagashima T, Morohoshi T, Tajiri M, Maehara T, Watanabe K, Arai H, Yamamoto T, Woo T, Nishii T, Ishikawa Y, Morita S, Masuda M.","Citation":"Jpn J Clin Oncol. 2020 Feb 17;50(2):198-205. doi: 10.1093/jjco/hyz164.","CreatedDate":"1/10/20","Abstract":"Acute exacerbation of interstitial pneumonia (AE-IP) is a lethal complication after lung surgery.

Patients were randomly allocated to one of two treatments: radiation alone (RT alone) (n = 18) or radiation combined with methylpredonisolone (RT + MP) (n = 20). Symptoms were scored by patients themselves using original Quality of Life (QOL) scores. Stratification by urinary hydroxyproline/creatinine ratios (Hypro/Cr) showed no significant differences in QOL scores between RT and RT + MP in the group with good prognosis, which showed a lower Hypro/Cr (< 3.6 mg/g) during treatment. Following treatment, the score for both groups improved. On the other hand, in the group with poor prognosis, with a higher Hypro/Cr (> or = 3.6 mg/g), a significantly greater improvement in QOL scores was observed for the RT + MP group than for the RT alone group (p < 0.05). There was also a marked difference in the RTOG pain scores, evaluated by physicians before treatment and at the end of treatment, between the two treatment groups and the prognostic groups divided according to Hypro/Cr.

However, since immune-related adverse events (irAEs) are potentially fatal, early recognition and prompt treatment are warranted. One of the rarest but most dramatic irAE is myocarditis, which has significant morbidity and mortality if not recognized and treated early. To report the first case of myocarditis in a patient with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) treated with a combination of nivolumab, an anti-programmed cell death protein 1 antibody, and PROSTVAC, a vector-based therapeutic prostate cancer vaccine. A 79-year-old man with mCRPC metastatic to bone and lymph nodes and a history of atrial fibrillation presented with blurred vision and pain and stiffness in the upper back after 8 weeks on a clinical trial with nivolumab (1 mg/kg) and PROSTVAC, both given every 2 weeks. Eye exam was within normal limits, while musculoskeletal exam revealed tenderness in trapezius muscles and decreased motor strength in arms (III/V) and neck (IV/V). The rest of the physical exam was within normal limits, with the exception of an irregular heart rhythm. Laboratory tests were as follows: creatinine kinase (CK) 3200 U/L (normal: 39-308 U/L), CK-MB 65.7 mcg/L (normal: 0-7.6 mcg/L), troponin I 0.209 ng/mL (normal: 0-0.056 ng/mL). Electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed atrial fibrillation with QT prolongation (QTc 514 msec) and left anterior fascicular block, unchanged from baseline. 2D-echocardiogram showed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 65% with an enlarged left atrium, dilated right ventricle, and increased pulmonary artery pressure (45 mmHg). ProBNP was elevated at 1463 pg/mL and peaked at 3066 pg/mL one day after hydration. With a presumed diagnosis of autoimmune myositis and possible myocarditis, the patient was admitted and started on methylprednisolone 1 mg/kg/day. Cardiac MRI showed elevated native myocardial T1 values consistent with myocarditis (Fig. 1). The patient was discharged on\xa0a prednisone taper after normalization of cardiac enzymes on day 4. Treatment with PROSTVAC continued for three more months; nivolumab was discontinued. Six months later, patient is doing well, with no residual cardiac damage. Cardiovascular irAEs are relatively rare (< 1%) and have a variety of clinical presentations. Myocarditis is potentially life-threatening and can range from subclinical to fulminant. Therefore, clinical suspicion, early detection, and prompt treatment are imperative (1). The initial diagnostic workup should include cardiac enzymes, ECG, and 2D-echocardiogram. The most commonly observed ECG changes are generalized repolarization abnormalities, prolonged QT interval, and conduction abnormalities (2). An elevated troponin I in the absence of overt coronary artery disease is suggestive of myocarditis and should be evaluated further. Myocardial biopsy is the standard diagnostic procedure; however, a cardiac MRI can achieve a diagnosis when biopsy is not feasible (3). Advancements in parametric mapping techniques have allowed the use of native myocardial T1 in the detection of myocarditis, as it has superior diagnostic performance and higher sensitivity than older parameters (3). Our patient had been treated with an immune checkpoint inhibitor and a therapeutic cancer vaccine to induce effective antitumor activity through immunogenic intensification and presented with muscle stiffness and elevated CK. Although he had no new cardiovascular symptoms, cardiac enzymes were tested to rule out myocardial involvement. MRI with gadolinium confirmed the diagnosis of myocarditis. To date, none of the 1360 patients treated with PROSTVAC as a single agent have developed myocarditis, while myocarditis has been rarely reported in patients treated with nivolumab (< 1%) (1). Whether the combination of PROSTVAC and nivolumab presents an additional risk of myocarditis is unclear. To our knowledge, this is the first case of myocarditis in a patient with mCRPC receiving simultaneous treatment with an immune checkpoint inhibitor and a prostate cancer vaccine. Our experience highlights the importance of suspicion and early intervention in patients who present with cardiac abnormalities after receiving cancer immunotherapy. We propose following protocol: baseline troponin, ECG, and 2D-echocardiogram prior to treatment, then repeated troponin at 2, 4, and 12 weeks post-treatment, then monthly. If troponin becomes positive without alternative explanation, myocarditis should be ruled out with cardiac MRI or myocardial biopsy, and patient should be admitted for treatment with high-dose steroids as early intervention may minimize myocardial injury.","IncludeStatus":"Exclude","LisedInColA":"No Label","originalFormulation":"No Label","AloneOrComb":"No Label","cancerType":"No Label","studyType":"No Label","therapeuticAssociation":"No Label"},{"id":"274","Drug":"Methylprednisolone","PMID":"30310049","Title":"A Case of Severe Anti-N-Methyl D-Aspartate (Anti-NMDA) Receptor Encephalitis with Refractory Autonomic Instability and Elevated Intracranial Pressure","Authors":"Salehi N, Yuan AK, Stevens G, Koshy R, Klein WF.","Citation":"Am J Case Rep. 2018 Oct 12;19:1216-1221. doi: 10.12659/AJCR.911165.","CreatedDate":"10/13/18","Abstract":"BACKGROUND Anti-N-methyl D-Aspartate (anti-NMDA) receptor encephalitis is a rare autoimmune panencephalitis that typically presents with acute psychiatric disturbances and neurological deficits. Anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis is associated with certain tumors, most commonly ovarian teratomas. First-line therapy typically involves immunotherapy and tumor resection, if present, with up to 53% of patients experiencing improvement within 4 weeks. Cardiac arrhythmias and increased intracranial pressure have been reported in anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis, but these complications have usually been self-limited. CASE REPORT We report the case of a previously healthy, obese 21-year-old female who presented with acute encephalopathy. Her psychiatric and neurological function rapidly deteriorated, warranting intubation and mechanical ventilation. Lumbar puncture was performed. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) opening pressure was elevated and a lumbar drain was placed. Infectious disease work-up was negative and anti-NMDA receptor antibodies were present in the CSF and serum. Initial treatment included intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) therapy, plasmapheresis, methylprednisolone, and bilateral salpingoophorectomy, without clinical improvement. Second-line immunotherapy with cyclophosphamide and rituximab was then administered. The patient also developed intermittent episodes of severe bradycardia and asystole that remained refractory to treatment and required placement of a permanent cardiac pacemaker. CONCLUSIONS Anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis presents with rapidly progressive psychiatric and neurologic dysfunction and can develop a severe and prolonged course with limited response to treatment. Patients can develop severe autonomic dysfunction with bradycardia and asystole that may require placement of permanent cardiac pacemakers. Elevated intracranial pressure may also be associated with anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis, and might contribute to the autonomic instability.","IncludeStatus":"Exclude","LisedInColA":"No Label","originalFormulation":"No Label","AloneOrComb":"No Label","cancerType":"No Label","studyType":"No Label","therapeuticAssociation":"No Label"},{"id":"275","Drug":"Methylprednisolone","PMID":"31382909","Title":"Pembrolizumab-related systemic myositis involving ocular and hindneck muscles resembling myasthenic gravis: a case report","Authors":"Kamo H, Hatano T, Kanai K, Aoki N, Kamiyama D, Yokoyama K, Takanashi M, Yamashita Y, Shimo Y, Hattori N.","Citation":"BMC Neurol. 2019 Aug 5;19(1):184. doi: 10.1186/s12883-019-1416-1.","CreatedDate":"8/7/19","Abstract":"Pembrolizumab is an immune-checkpoints inhibitor that enhances the immune response against cancer cells and therefore is useful for the treatment of several carcinomas. However, pembrolizumab sometimes perturbs the immune system resulting in various autoimmune neurological complications. In this situation, autoimmune myositis due to pembrolizumab is a rare but not-negligible complication. Here, we report two cases of autoimmune myositis due to pembrolizumab, with systemic myositis involving levator palpebrae superioris, extraocular and hindneck muscles. Case 1 was a 78-year-old man with advanced urinary cancer referred to the neurological ward presenting with bilateral ptosis, restriction of eye movements, dropped head and weakness in the lower extremities after pembrolizumab administration. His blood examination showed elevated serum levels of creatine kinase with positive anti-PM-Scl 75 and anti-signal recognition particle antibodies. Needle electromyography and MRI suggested systemic inflammatory myopathy. There were no findings to indicate myocardial involvement on electrocardiogram or echocardiogram. Administration of intravenous methylprednisolone following plasma exchange ameliorated creatine kinase levels and inhibited the progression of clinical symptoms. Case 2 was a 72-year-old female with lung cancer and multiple metastasis, including lymph nodes and brain. She presented with back pain, right-sided ptosis, weakness of her neck extensors and flexors and elevated serum creatine kinase after receiving pembrolizumab. Although myositis specific autoantibodies were negative, needle electromyography and MRI suggested systemic inflammatory myopathy and muscle biopsy indicated necrotizing myopathy. There were no signs indicating heart dysfunction and her electrocardiogram was normal. Clinical symptoms and serum creatine kinase levels were ameliorated after the administration of intravenous methylprednisolone. Both cases showed atypical extensive inflammatory myositis including levator palpebrae superioris, extraocular and hindneck muscles, resembling myasthenia gravis (MG), but they did not have MG-related antibodies. Edrophonium test was\xa0negative and showed no daily fluctuation. Two previously reported cases also presented with systemic necrotizing systemic myositis involving extraocular and facial muscles caused by pembrolizumab. Idiopathic inflammatory myositis evolving levator palpebrae superioris and ocular muscles is quite rare; however, myositis due to immune-checkpoint inhibitors may preferentially involve these muscles. This case report will alert physicians to the possibility of systemic inflammatory myopathy evolving levator palpebrae superioris, extraocular and hindneck muscles mimicking MG due to pembrolizumab.","IncludeStatus":"Exclude","LisedInColA":"No Label","originalFormulation":"No Label","AloneOrComb":"No Label","cancerType":"No Label","studyType":"No Label","therapeuticAssociation":"No Label"},{"id":"276","Drug":"Methylprednisolone","PMID":"28886955","Title":"Successful combined targeting of B- and plasma cells in treatment refractory anti-NMDAR encephalitis","Authors":"Sveinsson O, Granqvist M, Forslin Y, Blennow K, Zetterberg H, Piehl F.","Citation":"J Neuroimmunol. 2017 Nov 15;312:15-18. doi: 10.1016/j.jneuroim.2017.08.011.

A 64-year-old male presented at our hospital with right colic pain; he had received an ABO incompatible kidney transplant 6\u2009years earlier and was treated with cyclosporine, mycophenolate mofetil, and methylprednisolone. Radiological evaluation revealed a huge (11\u2009cm in diameter) solitary tumor at the small intestine without distant metastasis. The small intestinal wall at the tumor location was perforated one week after diagnosis and the patient underwent emergency surgery. The pathological findings were compatible with GIST and the tumor consisted of spindle cells with positive staining for KIT, CD34, and DOG1 and negative or weak staining for desmin and S-100 protein. A mutation in exon 11 of the c-kit gene was also detected. Cyclosporine was withdrawn and imatinib mesylate (400\u2009mg daily) was introduced. However, thereafter, we needed to decrease the dose at 300\u2009mg daily due to severe hyponatremia. Reduced imatinib treatment was well tolerated and recurrence was not observed for 18\u2009months after surgery. The occurrence of GISTs in transplant patients is rare, and huge GISTs should be resected immediately after diagnosis because gastrointestinal tract at the tumor site could be perforated. Imatinib treatment is feasible in transplant recipients under immunosuppression, although immunosuppressive drugs metabolized by CYP3A4 should be used at a reduced dosage or withdrawn.","IncludeStatus":"Include","LisedInColA":"No","originalFormulation":"Yes","AloneOrComb":"Alone","cancerType":"Esophagus/Stomach","studyType":"Clinical case report","therapeuticAssociation":"Effective"},{"id":"278","Drug":"Methylprednisolone","PMID":"31129638","Title":"Rapidly progressive global cerebral atrophy in the setting of anti-LGI1 encephalitis","Authors":"Yelam A, Nagarajan E, Bollu PC.","Citation":"BMJ Case Rep. 2019 May 24;12(5):e228428. doi: 10.1136/bcr-2018-228428.","CreatedDate":"5/27/19","Abstract":"A 47-year-old man presented with complaints of breakthrough seizures, psychiatric and behavioural changes and catatonic features.

A few days after nivolumab administration, grade 2-3 enterocolitis developed in the patient. The enterocolitis improved to grade 1 after careful observation; however, it was aggravated to grade 3 after resuming nivolumab treatment. After cessation of nivolumab, 3.3 mg of intravenous dexamethasone and 40 mg of methylprednisolone were administered for 16 days and subsequently 30-60 mg of oral prednisolone was administered for 50 days, with little improvement in the patient\'s colitis.

We conducted functional analyses of IL-6 in Western blotting and proliferation assays in vitro. We also investigated whether preoperative administration of methylprednisolone decreased postoperative serum IL-6 levels in cancer patients in a randomized clinical study. In the in vivo study, methylprednisolone inhibited the LPS-induced increase of serum IL-6 levels (mean, 33,756\xa0pg/ml vs. 5917\xa0pg/ml; P\u2009<\u20090.001), tumor volume (mean, 397\xa0mm<sup>3</sup> vs. 274\xa0mm<sup>3</sup>; P\u2009=\u20090.019), tumor weight (mean, 0.38\xa0g vs. 0.15\xa0g; P\u2009=\u20090.020), and the number of peritoneal nodules (mean, 112 vs. 47; P\u2009=\u20090.002).

We treated a 53-year-old woman with LC and brain lesions resembling neuro-Behcet\'s disease. She had a past history of acute uveitis and current symptoms of somnolence and gait disturbances progressing for one month. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed high signal lesions in the brain stem. Based on her past history and present clinical findings, she was clinically diagnosed with neuro-Behcet\'s disease, which was treated with 1 g of methylprednisolone (mPSL) pulse therapy. Repeated mPSL pulse therapy resulted in a minor response, but the cerebral lesions persisted. After a short remission of several months, signal changes of the brain stem lesion recurred and her consciousness level worsened at 4 months after diagnosis.

We report a patient affected with remarkably severe anti-GAD antibody-positive encephalitis after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). A 5-year-old girl received HSCT due to pineoblastoma. Thirteen months after HSCT, she showed seizure clustering and altered mental status. Her anti-GAD antibody level was high, 65,100\u202fU/mL (reference range\u202f<\u202f1.5\u202fU/mL). Her disease was diagnosed as autoimmune encephalitis and she received intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and methylprednisolone. After the therapy, she partially recovered. Encephalitis later relapsed, however, and she showed extremely high anti-GAD antibody, 27\u202fmonths after HSCT. Although lesions were located in the temporal and occipital lobes by MRI at 5\u202fdays after the relapse, very severe whole brain encephalitis was revealed at 13\u202fdays after the relapse. Seizures and abnormal encephalogram were resistant to IVIG and methylprednisolone. After plasma exchange, these findings were resolved. MRI revealed diffuse cerebral atrophy, 57\u202fmonths after the relapse. No relapse has occurred for the past 5\u202fyears with decreased anti-GAD antibody after starting bimonthly administration of IVIG. This may be the first case of severe and recurrent anti-GAD antibody-associated autoimmune encephalitis after HSCT with specific MRI findings.

At the time of relapse/progression, 13 (76 %) had NLPHL and 4 (24 %) had transformed diffuse large B cell lymphoma. The reason for HDC auto-SCT was refractory NLPHL in 12 patients and relapsed in 5 patients. Salvage chemotherapy was etoposide, methylprednisolone, cisplatinum, and Ara-C (ESHAP); eight patients also received rituximab with ESHAP. HDC was carmustine, etoposide, cytarabine, and melphalan (BEAM).

Subjects received ruxolitinib twice daily, lenalidomide daily on days 1-21 of a 28-day cycle, and methylprednisolone orally every other day. Primary endpoints were safety, clinical benefit rate (CBR), and overall response rate (ORR). Twenty-eight patients were enrolled.

Hence, alternative management options are often necessary. We describe our clinical experience with one such treatment alternative-denosumab for the treatment of ABC of Atlas. We present a case of 16-year-old boy who presented with neck pain and restriction of neck movements. A large lytic lesion with multiple fluid-fluid interfaces involving vertebral arch of atlas was identified on further imaging. There was destruction of right lateral mass and the lesion was found encasing the right vertebral artery. Core needle biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of ABC. With no visible CT response after first session of intra-lesional injection of Calcitonin and Methylprednisolone, the patient was treated with denosumab (120\xa0mg SC once-a-month) for a period of 12\xa0months.

However, the potential of CART therapy in treating advanced unresectable/metastatic CCA is uncharted so far. In this case, a 52-year-old female who was diagnosed as advanced unresectable/metastatic CCA and resistant to the following chemotherapy and radiotherapy was treated with CART cocktail immunotherapy, which was composed of successive infusions of CART cells targeting epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and CD133, respectively. The patient finally achieved an 8.5-month partial response (PR) from the CART-EGFR therapy and a 4.5-month-lasting PR from the CART133 treatment. The CART-EGFR cells induced acute infusion-related toxicities such as mild chills, fever, fatigue, vomiting and muscle soreness, and a 9-day duration of delayed lower fever, accompanied by escalation of IL-6 and C reactive protein (CRP), acute increase of glutamic-pyruvic transaminase and glutamic-oxalacetic transaminase, and grade 2 lichen striatus-like skin pathological changes. The CART133 cells induced an intermittent upper abdominal dull pain, chills, fever, and rapidly deteriorative grade 3 systemic subcutaneous hemorrhages and congestive rashes together with serum cytokine release, which needed emergent medical intervention including intravenous methylprednisolone. This case suggests that CART cocktail immunotherapy may be feasible for the treatment of CCA as well as other solid malignancies; however, the toxicities, especially the epidermal/endothelial damages, require a further investigation.

Out of 41 patients, 28 and 13 received first-line docetaxel according to the D3 and the D1 schedules respectively. An overall PSA response \u226550% was achieved in thirty patients (73%). In ten patients (24%) the PSA level was normalised. The median OS of the total population was 18.7 months. No significant differences were observed between the D3 and the D1 regimens with respect to PSA response, duration of PSA response, TOT, TFI and OS. Patients obtaining a normalisation of PSA level achieved a significantly superior OS, TOT and TFI compared to those without normalisation of PSA. Second-line treatment with docetaxel in nine patients induced a normalisation in PSA level in two (22%). The TOT and TFI from the start of second-line treatment, was significantly superior in docetaxel compared to non-docetaxel treated patients. Treatment with docetaxel was well-tolerated and only two patients were withdrawn for non-haematological toxicity during first- and further-line treatment. There were no differences in either subjective or objective side-effects between both treatment schedules. The results of the retrospective analysis of non-selected patients with mCRPC treated with docetaxel chemotherapy are in line with the data from TAX 327. Normalisation of PSA during first-line treatment with docetaxel is associated with a better survival irrespective of second- or further-line treatment used. Retreatment with docetaxel in second- or further-line remains a treatment option in docetaxel-sensitive patients.","IncludeStatus":"Include","LisedInColA":"No","originalFormulation":"Yes","AloneOrComb":"Combination","cancerType":"Prostate","studyType":"Review: Meta-analysis","therapeuticAssociation":"Effective"},{"id":"318","Drug":"Methylprednisolone","PMID":"30310723","Title":"Brentuximab Vedotin Infusion Reaction Management: A Case Study","Authors":"Comer H, Cardwell K.","Citation":"J Adv Pract Oncol. 2017 Sep-Oct;8(6):626-629.

Acute infusion reaction management and subsequent premedication strategies are outlined. Ms. R is a 30-year-old woman who presented with stage IV Hodgkin lymphoma at the age of 29. Initial staging revealed lymphadenopathy above and below the diaphragm, as well as fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-avid lung lesions, splenic lesions, and multiple sites of bony involvement. Bone marrow biopsy was negative. She was treated with six cycles of chemotherapy with doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine (ABVD), to which she obtained a complete response by positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) criteria. Ten months after chemotherapy completion, she presented with new PET-avid adenopathy in the cervical and paratracheal regions, and a biopsy revealed recurrent Hodgkin lymphoma. Salvage chemotherapy was administered with ifosfamide carboplatin, and etoposide (ICE). After two cycles of salvage chemotherapy, a PET-CT confirmed a complete response, and she proceeded to an autologous stem cell transplant with a preparative regimen of carmustine, etoposide, cytosine arabinoside, and melphalan (BEAM). Brentuximab vedotin consolidation therapy was prescribed in the post-transplant consolidation setting, beginning 45 days after stem cell reinfusion, given the patient\'s high risk for recurrence. This strategy was based upon the results of the AETHERA phase III clinical trial (Moskowitz et al., 2015), showing improvement in progression-free survival with brentuximab vedotin consolidation therapy, post autologous transplant. The first dose of brentuximab vedotin was administered without difficulty, at full dose (1.8 mg/kg) at a standard infusion time of 30 minutes. The second dose of brentuximab vedotin was complicated by nausea, chest pain, and dysphagia within 10 minutes of medication initiation. Upon the emergence of these symptoms, the brentuximab vedotin infusion was held. Vital signs were stable, with a temperature of 36.9\u02daC, pulse 84, respirations of 20, and blood pressure of 107/67 mm Hg. Oxygen saturations were 99% on room air. Diphenhydramine (50 mg) was administered intravenously (IV), along with 20 mg of IV famotidine. An electrocardiogram (ECG) was obtained, which was unremarkable, showing normal sinus rhythm. Fifteen minutes later, the symptoms of chest pain and shortness of breath persisted, so hydrocortisone at 100 mg IV was administered, with an additional 25 mg of IV diphenhydramine and 20 mg of IV famotidine. Intraveous granisetron was given for nausea. Thirty minutes after onset, the chest pain was persistent, and oxygen saturations were normal. Hydrocortisone (50 mg) was administered intravenously, and Ms. R\'s condition improved, with resolution of her symptoms within 30 minutes of the second hydrocortisone dose. The brentuximab vedotin was restarted 30 minutes after symptom resolution at a decreased infusion rate to be administered over 60 minutes. Thirty minutes later, however, Ms. R developed tingling and numbness in her feet and tongue. The brentuximab vedotin infusion was again held, and 100 mg of IV methylprednisolone was administered. Ms. R\'s symptoms resolved within 40 minutes, and the brentuximab vedotin infusion was able to be continued over a prolonged period of more than 4 hours. Vital signs were checked every 15 minutes during the infusion reaction and remained stable throughout. The infusion was discontinued with 40 mg of drug remaining, due to the prolonged infusion time. Given the clear benefits of brentuximab consolidation in improving progression-free survival post transplant (Moskowitz et al., 2015) in high-risk Hodgkin lymphoma, it was thought the benefit of brentuximab vedotin consolidation outweighed the possible risks of subsequent infusions. Upon reviewing the available literature regarding brentuximab vedotin hypersensitivity reactions, which will be outlined in the discussion summary, we instituted the premedication strategy for subsequent infusions outlined in the Table on p 628. Standard epinephrine and methylprednisolone were available at the bedside in the event of any anaphylactic reaction. This regimen was chosen based on the clinical rationale for H1 and H2 blockade, as well as corticosteroid and antipyretic coverage, in the prevention of hypersensitivity reactions, not classified as anaphylaxis. With the institution of the outlined premedications, Ms. R tolerated subsequent infusions well, at full dose and at standard infusion rates, with no documented infusion reactions, and was able to complete a total of 16 cycles of consolidation therapy.","IncludeStatus":"Exclude","LisedInColA":"No Label","originalFormulation":"No Label","AloneOrComb":"No Label","cancerType":"No Label","studyType":"No Label","therapeuticAssociation":"No Label"},{"id":"319","Drug":"Methylprednisolone","PMID":"25648048","Title":"Seminomatous extragonadal germ cell tumor with complete obstruction of the superior vena cava responding to intensive chemotherapy","Authors":"Moritoki Y, Kato T, Nishio H, Kamisawa H, Hirose Y, Ando R, Akita H, Okamura T.","Citation":"J Rural Med. 2011;6(1):32-4. doi: 10.2185/jrm.6.32.","CreatedDate":"2/5/15","Abstract":"A 20-year-old man was admitted to our hospital with persistent cough and dyspnea.

The standard therapy for this tumor is high-dose methotrexate chemotherapy(HD-MTX)and whole-brain irradiation. No salvage therapies for HD-MTX therapy-refractory or recurrent PCNSLs have been standardized. In our institution, ESHAP therapy(high-dose cytarabine:2,000mg, cisplatin:25mg/m<sup>2</sup>, etoposide:40mg/m<sup>2</sup>, methylprednisolone:500mg)was administered as a secondary chemotherapy, and the efficiency was examined. We administered ESHAP therapy as secondary chemotherapy for patients with refractory/recurrent PCNSL after HD-MTX therapy. Patients with PCNSL who were diagnosed and treated at our institute since 1996 were retrospectively studied. Clinical evaluations were performed based on Karnofsky Performance Status and overall survival, and the effect of ESHAP therapy was evaluated using the Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology criteria. The number of patients with refractory/recurrent PCNSLs were 18(28-77 years of age, median age of 58.5 years). The response rate(RR)after the first course of salvage ESHAP therapy was 77.8%(14 cases), and complete response(CR)was achieved in 6 cases. The RR after the final course of ESHAP therapy was as high as 61.1%(11 cases), and 4 patients retained CR status. In patients with refractory PCNSL who were treated with HD-MTX, the RR in the final course of salvage ESHAP therapy was as high as 77.8%(7 cases), and 3 patients retained CR status during the periods.

In an attempt to improve the treatment of TP53-defective CLL, a multicenter phase II study was developed to evaluate alemtuzumab and methylprednisolone in combination. Thirty-nine patients with TP53-deleted CLL (17 untreated and 22 previously treated) received up to 16 weeks of treatment with alemtuzumab 30 mg three times a week and methylprednisolone 1.0 g/m(2) for five consecutive days every 4 weeks. Antimicrobial prophylaxis consisted of cotrimoxazole, itraconazole, and aciclovir (or valganciclovir for asymptomatic cytomegalovirus viremia). The primary end point was response as assigned by an end-point review committee. Secondary end points were safety, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).

A 34-year-old male patient was diagnosed with ALL in June 2015. Complete remission (CR) was achieved after induction chemotherapy. The patient received 8 cycles of consolidation chemotherapy to maintain CR. In May 2017, the patient had recurrent ALL. Induction chemotherapy was given again, but without remission. In October 2017, CAR-T cell therapy was given. On October 14, the patient was pretreated with an FC regimen (fludarabine phosphate 50\u200amg qd on days 1-3; cyclophosphamide 0.4\u200ag qd on days 1-3).

On October 25, the patient had a high fever, swelling, and pain in the large joints of the limbs, and joint effusion. This patient was diagnosed with relapsed ALL, and he developed CRS after CAR-T therapy. Tacilizumab (400\u200amg) was infused after CRS was diagnosed, and another dose of tacilizumab (240\u200amg) was given 6 days later. The pain was also treated with an analgesic drug. Methylprednisolone (1\u200amg/kg) was given to treat arthritis of the large joints. The patient\'s temperature was back to normal within 1\u200ahour following the treatment of tacilizumab, but the pain in the large joints was progressively aggravated. The joint swelling and pain were obviously alleviated after the treatment of methylprednisolone, and the joint mobility was gradually recovered. CRS after CAR-T therapy can manifest as a high fever with swelling and pain in the large joints of the limbs, similar to rheumatoid arthritis. Tocilizumab can lower the body temperature, but it has no significant effect on arthritis. Glucocorticoids can rapidly alleviate joint swelling and pain.","IncludeStatus":"Exclude","LisedInColA":"No Label","originalFormulation":"No Label","AloneOrComb":"No Label","cancerType":"No Label","studyType":"No Label","therapeuticAssociation":"No Label"},{"id":"330","Drug":"Methylprednisolone","PMID":"12170023","Title":"Randomized study of the benefits of preoperative corticosteroid administration on the postoperative morbidity and cytokine response in patients undergoing surgery for esophageal cancer","Authors":"Sato N, Koeda K, Ikeda K, Kimura Y, Aoki K, Iwaya T, Akiyama Y, Ishida K, Saito K, Endo S.","Citation":"Ann Surg. 2002 Aug;236(2):184-90. doi: 10.1097/00000658-200208000-00006.","CreatedDate":"8/10/02","Abstract":"To investigate whether preoperative corticosteroid administration plays a role in attenuating postoperative morbidity.

A total of 30 patients with proven metastatic or recurrent SCCHN were treated with docetaxel 36 mg/m weekly for 6 weeks in an 8-week schedule. Dexamethasone 20 mg or methylprednisolone 32 mg was administered 12 and 3 hours before docetaxel. No prophylactic antibiotics or growth factors were given. The primary end point was objective response rate and the secondary end points included time to progression and overall survival. Patients received a median of 6 administrations (range, 1-27). A partial response was documented in 2 patients (6.7%). The disease control rate defined the percentage of patients with responding or stable disease was 33.3%. The median progression-free survival was 7.4 weeks (95% confidence interval, 5.5-9.3 weeks) and the median overall survival was 17.9 weeks (95% confidence interval, 10.1-25.6 weeks). There were no episodes of grade 4 neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, or nonhematological toxicity. Weekly docetaxel at a dose of 36 mg/m has a mild to moderate toxicity profile in SCCHN patients. However, the response rate in predominantly pretreated patients is low and the overall survival is short.","IncludeStatus":"Include","LisedInColA":"No","originalFormulation":"Yes","AloneOrComb":"Combination","cancerType":"Head and Neck","studyType":"Clinical trial","therapeuticAssociation":"No effect"},{"id":"332","Drug":"Methylprednisolone","PMID":"9669469","Title":"Treatment of myasthenia gravis with methylprednisolone pulse: a double blind study","Authors":"Lindberg C, Andersen O, Lefvert AK.","Citation":"Acta Neurol Scand. 1998 Jun;97(6):370-3. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0404.1998.tb05968.x.","CreatedDate":"7/21/98","Abstract":"To evaluate the efficacy and safety of one single intravenous methylprednisolone (IVMP) pulse therapy in myasthenia gravis.

This consensus is supported by the results of several series, including a randomized German trial. Here we report 11-year results of the latter trial. With stringent response criteria and 4 months as the time to evaluate responses, this analysis confirms the superiority of the cyclosporine regimen regarding the response rate in all patients treated (70% vs 41%, with or without cyclosporine; P =.015) and in patients with severe aplastic anemia (65% vs 31%; P =.011). Patients responded more rapidly after treatment with cyclosporine (median, 60 vs 82 days; P =.019). Most patients treated with cyclosporine needed only one course of immunosuppression, whereas many patients treated without cyclosporine required repeated immunosuppressive treatment. Because of the efficacy of salvage treatment, overall survival was not different between the 2 treatment groups. However, failure-free survival favored the cyclosporine regimen (39% vs 24%; P =.04). The relapse rate, projected at 38% after 11.3 years, was similar between the 2 treatment groups. Remissions were cyclosporine dependent in 26% of the patients responding to a regimen that included cyclosporine. Clonal or malignant diseases developed in 25% of the patients. These data demonstrate that antithymocyte globulin, methylprednisolone, and cyclosporin A are an effective regimen for the treatment of aplastic anemia. However, remissions are unstable, and secondary diseases are common. In contrast to the results of stem cell transplantation, most patients are not cured.","IncludeStatus":"Exclude","LisedInColA":"No Label","originalFormulation":"No Label","AloneOrComb":"No Label","cancerType":"No Label","studyType":"No Label","therapeuticAssociation":"No Label"},{"id":"335","Drug":"Methylprednisolone","PMID":"25332569","Title":"A Case of Advanced Primary Thyroid Double-Hit B Cell Lymphoma in Which Complete Remission has been Maintained After High-Dose Chemotherapy and Autologous Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation Performed During the Second Remission, with a Review of the Literature","Authors":"Sekiguchi Y, Shimada A, Imai H, Wakabayashi M, Sugimoto K, Nakamura N, Sawada T, Ohta Y, Komatsu N, Noguchi M.","Citation":"Indian J Hematol Blood Transfus. 2014 Sep;30(Suppl 1):166-73. doi: 10.1007/s12288-013-0312-x.

While corticosteroids have been used to treat CLL since 1940s, their benefit has never been conclusively proved. Recently, several groups reported use of high-dose corticosteroids (methylprednisolone or dexamethasone) either alone or combined with chemotherapy and/or monoclonal antibodies in relapsed/refractory CLL. While efficacy of high-dose corticosteroids is excellent including responses in patients with bulky lymphadenopathy or those considered ultra high-risk CLL because of deletion and/or mutation of p53 gene, the duration of response is still unsatisfactory. Combination with monoclonal antibodies seems to improve therapeutic efficacy but no randomized trials have been conducted. For the purpose of this review, a search for terms, high-dose corticosteroids/methylprednisolone/dexamethasone, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia has been performed in PubMed and database of abstracts from American Society of Hematology Meetings. High-dose corticosteroids appear to play an important role in the management of highly pretreated relapsed/refractory CLL including patients with massive lymphadenopathy. Myelosuppression is usually limited but infectious toxicity, including increased risk of invasive fungal infections, represents the most dreaded side effects. This therapeutic approach should be further tested within large prospective trials, to optimize efficacy and safety.","IncludeStatus":"Exclude","LisedInColA":"No Label","originalFormulation":"No Label","AloneOrComb":"No Label","cancerType":"No Label","studyType":"No Label","therapeuticAssociation":"No Label"},{"id":"340","Drug":"Methylprednisolone","PMID":"32300428","Title":"Efficacy of ESHAP Regimen in Transplant Ineligible Patients With Relapsed/Refractory T-Cell Lymphoma","Authors":"Norasetthada L, Tantiworawit A, Rattanathammethee T, Chai-Adisaksopha C, Chaipoh T, Rattarittamrong E.","Citation":"J Hematol. 2018 Dec;7(4):131-139. doi: 10.14740/jh459w.

Though, the evidence of long-term efficacy of ESHAP on R/R PTCLs is limited. This study aims to determine the efficacy and safety of ESHAP as a first salvage regimen, not followed by autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT), in R/R PTCLs. Patients with PTCLs, who progressed after one prior therapy and received ESHAP as a salvage treatment without subsequent ASCT, were recruited from the prospective observational study in the patients with lymphoma. From January 2005 to April 2015, 33 patients with R/R PTCLs received ESHAP as first salvage regimen at Chiang Mai University Hospital. The overall response rate was 46% (complete remission (CR) 39%). The median duration of response was 18 months. Median second progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 8.0 and 11.0 months, respectively. Patients having late relapse had more favorable OS than those having early relapsed or refractory disease with a median OS of 21, 17 and 3 months, respectively (P = 0.001). Patients achieving CR after ESHAP had significantly better median OS (39, 7 and 5 months, P < 0.0001) and second PFS (33, 2 and 2 months, P < 0.0001) than those achieving PR or having progressive disease. Grade 3-4 neutropenia (45.5%) and thrombocytopenia (33.4%) were common but manageable.

Over 2.5 years, 523 major thoracic operations were performed with postoperative ARDS developing in 20 patients (3.8%), of which 8 were treated with conventional therapy and 12 with early low-dose steroid therapy. Early low-dose steroid therapy significantly reduced postoperative mortality, with 7 patients (58.3%) recovering without mechanical ventilation. We believe this is the first clinical study of low-dose methylprednisolone at an early phase of postoperative ARDS.

Observational, prospective cohort study of patients admitted to a medical intensive care unit (ICU). Swabbing of nares, pharynx and rectum, and culture of respiratory secretions were obtained within 48 h of admission and thrice weekly thereafter. Clinical samples were obtained as deemed necessary by the attending physician. Clinical variables, severity scores on admission and exposures during ICU stay were also collected. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate ICU mortality. Out of 969 included patients 127 (13.1%) had HM and 93 (9.6%) had ST. Patients with malignancies were more frequently exposed to central venous catheterization, methylprednisolone, and any antipseudomonal antibiotic whereas they were less commonly exposed to invasive mechanical ventilation. Patients with HM were more often admitted with an infection. There were no differences among groups in terms of RPRMs acquisition during ICU stay or prevalence of ICU-acquired infections due to any microorganism, including RPRMs. Having a HM was an independent predictor of mortality regardless of APACHE II score. Critically ill cancer patients did not show a higher rate of RPRMs acquisition nor ICU-acquired infections. Mortality was higher in the HM group and it was not accurately predicted on admission by APACHE II score.","IncludeStatus":"Exclude","LisedInColA":"No Label","originalFormulation":"No Label","AloneOrComb":"No Label","cancerType":"No Label","studyType":"No Label","therapeuticAssociation":"No Label"},{"id":"347","Drug":"Methylprednisolone","PMID":"18712461","Title":"Successful treatment of parainfluenza virus 3 pneumonia with oral ribavirin and methylprednisolone in a bone marrow transplant recipient","Authors":"Shima T, Yoshimoto G, Nonami A, Yoshida S, Kamezaki K, Iwasaki H, Takenaka K, Miyamoto T, Harada N, Teshima T, Akashi K, Nagafuji K.","Citation":"Int J Hematol. 2008 Oct;88(3):336-340. doi: 10.1007/s12185-008-0148-6.

Twenty-nine patients were treated at Indiana University with bortezomib (1.3 mg/m2) and methylprednisolone (500-2000 mg) intravenously on days 1, 8, and 15 of 28-day cycles. Response was evaluated using the Blade criteria. Twenty-one patients (70%) had previous stem cell transplantation, and 13 were in third relapse or higher. A response was observed in 18 patients (62%): 1 (3%) complete response, 1 (3%) near complete response, and 16 (55%) partial responses. Six (21%) had stable disease, and 5 (17%) had disease progression. The median time to progression, which was defined from the beginning of therapy until progression, was 6.6 months (95% confidence interval, 6.4-9.2 months). The median number of treatment cycles was 6 (range, 2-12 cycles). The median overall survival was 20.2 months (lower 95% confidence interval, 13.1 months).

Vertebral metastases are a major cause of motor deficit of the lower extremities. The use of radiotherapy is the treatment of choice in these patients. A temporary worsening of pain shortly during the course of palliative radiotherapy is clinically a common problem. Steroid infusion has well-documented neuroprotective effects. Our study objective is to evaluate the effect of pre-emptive infusion of methylprednisolone on pain flare and motor function in patients with vertebral metastases. One hundred twenty patients with vertebral metastases received short-course external beam radiotherapy as high-voltage irradiation with a 6 MeV, via linear accelerator. In addition to the short-course radiotherapy, 60 patients received pre-emptive methylprednisolone infusion (5 mg/kg) the day just before initiation of radiotherapy (Group 1 [G1]). The other 60 patients received short-course radiotherapy without pretreatment methylprednisolone infusion, and only normal saline was infused (Group 2 [G2]). The Brief Pain Inventory, incidence of pain flare during radiotherapy, and motor functions were evaluated using the Tomita scale at the time of initial assessment, at the end of external beam radiotherapy, and after two weeks. Four patients (6.6%) in G1 experienced pain flare compared with 12 patients (20%) in G2 during the two-week short-course radiotherapy. The mean values of pain scores were significantly reduced in both groups at the end of radiotherapy; the mean value of worst, average, and current pain scores in G1 remained statistically significant in comparison to pretreatment and G2 mean values two weeks later. Significant increase was noticed in patients with normal motor and ambulatory status in G1 at two and four weeks of initial assessment. Pre-emptive methylprednisolone infusion is an effective prophylactic agent in the prevention of radiation-induced pain flare and improves functional motor status after short-term radiotherapy in patients with vertebral metastases.","IncludeStatus":"Exclude","LisedInColA":"No Label","originalFormulation":"No Label","AloneOrComb":"No Label","cancerType":"No Label","studyType":"No Label","therapeuticAssociation":"No Label"},{"id":"364","Drug":"Methylprednisolone","PMID":"18285252","Title":"Primary biliary cirrhosis and IgG-kappa type multiple myeloma both respond well to vincristine, adriamycin and dexamethasone: is there a pathogenic relationship?","Authors":"Saka B, Kalayoglu-Besisik S, Ozturk GB, Dogan O, Erten N.","Citation":"J Formos Med Assoc. 2008 Feb;107(2):185-90. doi: 10.1016/S0929-6646(08)60133-3.","CreatedDate":"2/21/08","Abstract":"Patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) are at increased risk for various malignancies including lymphoproliferative diseases.

Rituximab is the most important monoclonal antibody of clinical value in these disorders. Rituximab is an IgG1 chimeric antibody containing murine light- and heavy-chain variable region sequences and human constant region sequences. Since approval in 1997, rituximab has become the standard of care in follicular B-cell lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and aggressive lymphoma when combined with chemotherapy. Higher clinical benefits of rituximab can be seen in patients with CLL when it is added to other chemotherapeutic agents. Several recent reports have suggested that in patients with CLL, rituximab combined with purine nucleoside analogs (PNAs) or PNAs and cyclophosphamide may improve the results with acceptable toxicity, both in previously untreated and refractory/relapsed patients. The randomized, multinational Phase III study (REACH trial) has shown that rituximab combined with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide (R-FC regimen) results in 10 months longer progression-free survival, and higher overall response and complete response rates than fludarabine and cyclophosphamide (FC regimen) in previously treated patients. The German CLL study group initiated a multicenter, multinational Phase III trial, CLL8, to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of R-FC versus FC for the first-line treatment of patients with advanced CLL. The overall response rate was significantly higher in the R-FC arm (95%) compared with FC (88%). The complete response rate in the R-FC arm was 44% compared with 27% in the FC arm. The recently updated analysis has demonstrated longer overall survival in the R-FC group. Recent clinical observations have revealed that combinations of rituximab with pentostatin and cyclophosphamide, or cladribine and cyclophosphamide are also highly active regimens in previously untreated CLL. In addition, the results of treatment with high-dose methylprednisolone in combination with rituximab in advanced CLL resistant to fludarabine have been reported recently by several groups. However, available therapies are only partially effective in CLL, exposing an obvious need to develop new, more specific and active drugs. Recently, several new anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies have been developed and are now being evaluated in clinical trials.","IncludeStatus":"Include","LisedInColA":"No","originalFormulation":"Yes","AloneOrComb":"Combination","cancerType":"Lymphoid","studyType":"Clinical trial","therapeuticAssociation":"Effective"},{"id":"366","Drug":"Methylprednisolone","PMID":"28693060","Title":"[An analysis of four cases of misdiagnosed primary lymphocytic hypophysitis]","Authors":"Wei Q, Zang L, Li YJ, Gu WJ, Jin N, Guo QH, Du J, Ba JM, Lyu ZH, Lu JM, Dou JT, Mu YM, Yang GQ.","Citation":"Zhonghua Nei Ke Za Zhi. 2017 Jul 1;56(7):512-515. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.issn.0578-1426.2017.07.008.","CreatedDate":"7/11/17","Abstract":"To improve the differential diagnosis of sellar region mass, 4 cases with sellar mass and misdiagnosed as lymphocytic hypophysitis (LYH) were reviewed retrospectively.The 4 patients (2 male and 2 female) aged 20-60 years old were all presented with symptoms of headache, polydipsia and polyuria.Biochemical studies confirmed the diagnoses of central diabetes insipidus and hypopituitarism.Head MRI scans showed LYH like image for all the cases, and, thus, high dose methylprednisolone pulse therapy (HDMPT) was applied to the patients.Their symptoms deteriorated and the sellar mass enlarged after a short period of partial improvement.Operations were performed in all the patients.Histology study showed craniopharyngioma with abscess, primary abscess, secondary hypophysitis caused by Wegener\'s granulomatosis, and germinoma with secondary hypophysitis, respectively.In conclusion, surgery or biopsy is necessary for those who presented with sellar region mass and was suspected to be with LYH, but with poor response or even worse after HDMPT.","IncludeStatus":"Exclude","LisedInColA":"No Label","originalFormulation":"No Label","AloneOrComb":"No Label","cancerType":"No Label","studyType":"No Label","therapeuticAssociation":"No Label"},{"id":"367","Drug":"Methylprednisolone","PMID":"27442668","Title":"Bi-cytopenia possibly induced by anti-PD-1 antibody for primary malignant melanoma of the esophagus: A case report","Authors":"Inadomi K, Kumagai H, Arita S, Tsuruta N, Takayoshi K, Mishima K, Ota S, Tanaka M, Okumura Y, Sagara K, Nio K, Nakano M, Uchi H, Yamamoto H, Ariyama H, Kusaba H, Niiro H, Oda Y, Akashi K, Baba E.","Citation":"Medicine (Baltimore). 2016 Jul;95(29):e4283. doi: 10.1097/MD.0000000000004283.","CreatedDate":"7/22/16","Abstract":"Anti-programmed cell death 1 antibody nivolumab is a promising agent for various cancers.

The complications were assessed on the basis of the World Health Organization criteria. Nine patients (28%) had a complete response and 8 patients (25%) had a partial response. In responders, the median duration of remission was 6 months. By the end of the first year, 27% of the patients were still disease free and 66% were alive. High serum levels of lactate dehydrogenase had an adverse effect on disease-free survival, but no effect on overall survival (OS).

Of these, 20 patients were evaluable for response. The median age was 38 years (range 17-64 years). Histological subtypes were: nodular sclerosing HD (n = 10), diffuse large B cell (n = 5), T cell-rich B cell (n = 2), follicular (n = 2), mantle cell (n = 1) and enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma (n = 1). The median remission duration prior to receiving GEM-P was only 42 d. The overall objective response rate was 80%[95% confidence interval (CI): 56-94%], including five complete and 11 partial responses. GEM-P induced responses in all histological subtypes, primary progressive disease and patients who had received a previous autograft. The only grade 3-4 toxicity was myelosuppression. However, no cases of febrile neutropenia or haemorrhage with thrombocytopenia were encountered. Median survival has not yet been reached and survival probability at 1 year was 60.8% (95% CI: 31.9-80.5%). In conclusion, GEM-P is a novel combination salvage therapy for poor-prognostic primary progressive or multiply relapsed lymphoma patients.

Smooth muscle tumors (SMT), including leiomyosarcoma, are rare in kidney transplant recipients, and most cases are associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection. A 57-year-old man received a deceased donor kidney transplant at the age of 53 years, with 5 human leukocyte antigen (HLA) mismatches. Before the transplantation, the patient was IgG positive for EBV viral capsid antigen (VCA), negative for IgM EBV VCA, and also negative for IgG EBV nuclear antigen (EBNA), suggesting a prior EBV infection. He received immunosuppressive induction with basiliximab, and maintenance with tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and prednisolone. Two years after transplantation, he had an acute cellular rejection episode treated with methylprednisolone. An increased graft size was found 4 years after transplantation. A computed tomographic scan showed 3 solid tumors involving the renal graft with extension to the perinephric fat; no secondary localizations were found. A nephrectomy of the graft was performed. The histologic diagnosis was a high-grade leiomyosarcoma. In situ hybridization for EBV was negative. Nine months after nephrectomy, local recurrence was diagnosed. The surgical approach was unsuccessful, and the patient died after a brief period. Kidney leiomyosarcoma is a very rare clinical condition. Most of these neoplasms that arise in transplanted recipients are associated with EBV in tumor tissue. Only one case of renal graft leiomyosarcoma without EBV RNA in the tumor has been previously reported.","IncludeStatus":"Exclude","LisedInColA":"No Label","originalFormulation":"No Label","AloneOrComb":"No Label","cancerType":"No Label","studyType":"No Label","therapeuticAssociation":"No Label"},{"id":"390","Drug":"Methylprednisolone","PMID":"27297406","Title":"Perforation in an intestinal malignant lymphoma case","Authors":"Imataki O, Shiroshita K, Uchida S, Kida J, Akamoto S, Uemura M.","Citation":"BMC Res Notes. 2016 Jun 13;9:308. doi: 10.1186/s13104-016-2111-6.","CreatedDate":"6/15/16","Abstract":"The gastrointestinal tract is a relatively common involvement site in lymphoma and, in such cases, intestinal perforation is a concern before and during chemotherapy. The prediction of intestinal perforation prior to chemotherapy is difficult, and there is no standard strategy to minimize the frequency of severely adverse gastrointestinal events in lymphoma cases. The 61-year-old female patient had a history of primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL), diagnosed histologically as diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL). We administered six courses of intensive chemotherapy consisting of high-dose methotrexate and sequential whole-brain irradiation (40.5\xa0Gy).

We administered intensive salvage chemotherapy consisting of cyclophosphamide, high-dose AraC, methyl-prednisolone, etoposide, and rituximab. The response was a rapid partial response, but on day 10 after the initiation of salvage chemotherapy, she complained of abdominal pain with tenderness.

The pathological findings of resected intestine confirmed the elimination of the majority of lymphoma cells and concomitant partial necrotic tissue. We were able to avoid the neutropenic period and safely conducted the surgical treatment for the subclinical perforation by using CE-CT.

However, the transplant outcomes of HID-HSCT using very low-dose ATG (thymoglobulin, 2-2.5\xa0mg/kg) and methylprednisolone (mPSL, 1\xa0mg/kg) for patients with RRAL have not been reported. We compared the outcomes of 46 patients with RRAL who underwent HID-HSCT using very low-dose ATG (thymoglobulin) and mPSL with the outcomes of 72 patients who underwent non-HID-HSCT. Patient characteristics differed regarding conditioning intensity (myeloablative; 19.6% in HID-HSCT vs. 61.1% in non-HID-HSCT, P\u2009<\u20090.001) and having undergone multiple HSCT (26.1% vs. 11.1%, P\u2009=\u20090.045). However, we found no significant differences in the 1-year overall survival (OS, 31.7% vs. 29.1%; P\u2009=\u20090.25), disease-free survival (DFS, 20.5% vs. 23.7%; P\u2009=\u20090.23), cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR, 40.0% vs. 42.8%; P\u2009=\u20090.92), non-relapse mortality (NRM, 39.5% vs. 33.5%; P\u2009=\u20090.22), or 100-day grade II-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (32.6% vs. 34.7%; P\u2009=\u20090.64) following HID-HSCT vs. non-HID-HSCT, respectively. Subgroup analysis stratified by disease and intensity of conditioning regimen demonstrated the same results between HID-HSCT and non-HID-HSCT. Furthermore, multivariate analysis showed that HID-HSCT was not an independent prognostic factor for OS (hazard ratio (HR)\u2009=\u20090.95 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.58-1.58]), DFS (HR\u2009=\u20091.05 [95%CI, 0.67-1.68]), CIR (HR\u2009=\u20090.84 [95%CI, 0.48-1.47]), or NRM (HR\u2009=\u20091.28 [95%CI, 0.66-2.46]). In summary, transplant outcomes for RRAL were comparable in the HID-HSCT and non-HID-HSCT groups.

Medical therapy with rituximab, pulse methylprednisolone, and prednisone led to improvement in her symptoms. The patient\'s presentation is consistent with a rapid progression of pre-existing limited scleroderma with the development of new rheumatological symptoms, including vasculitis.

The median time to disease progression and median overall survival time were 5 and 13.5 months, respectively. In total, 415 cycles of docetaxel were administered (arm A: N = 219, median = six; arm B: N = 196, median = five). The most common toxicity observed was grade 3 or 4 neutropenia, which occurred in 79% of patients. Clinically significant nonhematologic side effects included skin reactions and asthenia. In an intent-to-treat analysis, patients who received methylprednisolone premedication had a delayed onset of FR (median time to onset of FR: arm A, 84 days; arm B, 62 days; P = .01) and received a higher median cumulative dose of docetaxel before the onset of FR (arm A, 333 mg/m2; arm B, 215 mg/m2; P = .001). There was no statistically significant difference in the incidence of skin toxicity between the two arms. Docetaxel, at this dose and schedule, has definite antitumor activity in pretreated MBC patients. Moreover, this is the first randomized trial to show that corticosteroids have a favorable impact on docetaxel-induced FR.","IncludeStatus":"Include","LisedInColA":"No","originalFormulation":"Yes","AloneOrComb":"Combination","cancerType":"Breast","studyType":"Clinical trial","therapeuticAssociation":"Effective"},{"id":"403","Drug":"Methylprednisolone","PMID":"15926630","Title":"[Diagnosis, care, and therapeutic possibilities in intravascular B-cell lymphoma--a case report]","Authors":"Tak\u221a\xb0cs I, Tordai L, Eros N, M\u221a\u2265rocz I, Bozs\u221a\u2265 F, K\u221a\xb0rolyi Z, Radv\u221a\xb0nyi G, Matolcsy A.","Citation":"Orv Hetil. 2005 May 1;146(18):843-8.","CreatedDate":"6/2/05","Abstract":"The cutaneous angiotropic lymphoma has a poor prognosis.

Of these, two patients (5 %) developed graft-versus-host disease within the irradiated tissues during or immediately after radiation therapy. The first patient is a 37-year-old white man who had Hodgkin lymphoma; he underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation from a matched unrelated donor and received radiation therapy for an abdominal and pelvic nodal recurrence. After 28.8 Gy, he developed grade 4 gastrointestinal graft-versus-host disease, refractory to tacrolimus and steroids, but responsive to pentostatin and photopheresis. The other patient is a 24-year-old white man who had acute leukemia; he underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation from a matched related donor and received craniospinal irradiation for a central nervous system relapse. After 24 cobalt Gy equivalent, he developed severe cutaneous graft-versus-host disease, sharply delineated within the radiation therapy field, which was responsive to tacrolimus and methylprednisolone. We conclude that graft-versus-host disease within irradiated tissues is an uncommon but potentially serious complication that may follow radiation therapy in patients who have undergone allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Clinicians must be aware of this complication and prepared with strategies to mitigate risk. Patients who have undergone allogeneic stem cell transplantation represent a unique population that may offer novel insight into the pathways involved in radiation-related inflammation.","IncludeStatus":"Exclude","LisedInColA":"No Label","originalFormulation":"No Label","AloneOrComb":"No Label","cancerType":"No Label","studyType":"No Label","therapeuticAssociation":"No Label"},{"id":"407","Drug":"Methylprednisolone","PMID":"27324449","Title":"Multidisciplinary treatment for prepubertal juvenile myasthenia gravis with crisis","Authors":"Hirata Y, Inoue M, Nabatame S, Okumura M, Ozono K.","Citation":"Pediatr Int. 2016 Aug;58(8):772-4. doi: 10.1111/ped.12957.

We report a rare case of orthotopic liver transplantation in a patient with a giant MHL. In 2013, a 34-year-old female sought medical advice after a 2-year history of progressive abdominal distention and respiratory distress. Physical examination revealed an extensive mass in the abdomen. Computed tomography (CT) of her abdomen revealed multiple liver cysts, with the diameter of largest cyst being 16 cm \xd7 14 cm. The liver hilar structures were not clearly displayed. The adjacent organs were compressed and displaced. Initial laboratory tests, including biochemical investigations and coagulation profile, were unremarkable. Tumor markers, including levels of AFP, CEA and CA19-9, were within the normal ranges. The patient underwent orthotopic liver transplantation in November 2013, the liver being procured from a 40-year-old man after cardiac death following traumatic brain injury. Warm ischemic time was 7.5 min and cold ischemic time was 3 h. The recipient underwent classical orthotopic liver transplantation. The recipient operative procedure took 8.5 h, the anhepatic phase lasting for 1 h without the use of venovenous bypass. The immunosuppressive regimen included intraoperative induction with basiliximab and high-dose methylprednisolone, and postoperative maintenance with tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and prednisone. The recipient\'s diseased liver weighed 21 kg (dry weight) and measured 41 cm \xd7 32 cm \xd7 31 cm. Histopathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of an MHL. The patient did not experience any acute rejection episode or other complication. All the laboratory tests returned to normal within one month after surgery. Three months after transplantation, the immunosuppressive therapy was reduced to tacrolimus monotherapy, and the T-tube was removed after cholangiography showed no abnormalities. Twelve months after transplantation, the patient remains well and is fulfilling all normal activities. Adult giant MHL is extremely rare. Symptoms, physical signs, laboratory results, and radiographic imaging are nonspecific and inconclusive. Surgical excision of the lesion is imperative to make a definite diagnosis and as a cure. Liver transplantation should be considered as an option in the treatment of a non-resectable MHL.

The median duration of SIRS in the sivelestat-treated group was significantly shorter than that in the control group: 17 (range 9-36) hours versus 49 (15-60) hours, respectively (P= 0.009). Concerning the parameters used for the diagnosis of SIRS, the median heart rates on postoperative day (POD) 2 were significantly lower in the sivelestat-treated group than in the control group (P= 0.007). The median arterial oxygen pressure/fraction of inspired oxygen ratio of the sivelestat-treated group were significantly higher than those of the control group on POD 1 and POD 7 (POD 1: 372.0 [range 284.0-475.0] vs 322.5 [243.5-380.0], respectively, P= 0.040; POD 7: 377.2 [339.5-430.0] vs 357.6 [240.0-392.8], P= 0.031). Postoperative white blood cell counts, serum C-reactive protein levels, plasma interleukin-1beta, tumor necrosis factor-alpha levels, and plasma NE levels did not differ significantly between the two groups at any point during the postoperative course, nor did serum Krebs von den Lungen 6, surfactant protein-A, or surfactant protein-D levels, which were used as markers of alveolar type II epithelial cells to evaluate the severity of lung injury. Plasma interleukin-8 levels were significantly lower in the sivelestat-treated group than in the control group on POD 3 (P= 0.040). In conclusion, perioperative administration of sivelestat sodium hydrate (starting at the beginning of surgery) mitigated postoperative hypoxia, partially suppressed postoperative hypercytokinemia, shortened the duration of SIRS, and stabilized postoperative circulatory status after thoracoscopic esophagectomy.","IncludeStatus":"Exclude","LisedInColA":"No Label","originalFormulation":"No Label","AloneOrComb":"No Label","cancerType":"No Label","studyType":"No Label","therapeuticAssociation":"No Label"},{"id":"417","Drug":"Methylprednisolone","PMID":"1586708","Title":"Immunosuppressive therapy of aplastic anemia: results of a prospective, randomized trial of antithymocyte globulin (ATG), methylprednisolone, and oxymetholone to ATG, very high-dose methylprednisolone, and oxymetholone","Authors":"Doney K, Pepe M, Storb R, Bryant E, Anasetti C, Appelbaum FR, Buckner CD, Sanders J, Singer J, Sullivan K, et al.","Citation":"Blood. 1992 May 15;79(10):2566-71.","CreatedDate":"5/15/92","Abstract":"Sixty-eight patients with moderate (n = 15) or severe (n = 53) aplastic anemia were entered into a prospective, randomized, two-arm treatment study comparing antihuman thymocyte globulin (ATG), lower-dose methylprednisolone (LDM) and oxymetholone to ATG, higher-dose methylprednisolone (HDM), and oxymetholone.

The purpose of the present study was to compare the influence of different treatment protocols that include high-dose methylprednisolone (HDMP) versus conventional-dose prednisolone (CDP) for remission-induction therapy on bone mineral density (BMD) and serum bone turnover markers in survivors of childhood ALL after cessation of chemotherapy. Thirty-six boy and 23 girl survivors, treated for ALL, were cross-sectionally studied, at a mean age of 11.7 years (range 6-19). Group 1 (n = 30) received CDP therapy (prednisolone, 2 mg/kg/day, orally) and group 2 (n = 29) received HDMP therapy (prednol-L, 900-600 mg/m2, orally). All other therapies were similar in both groups. Cranial irradiation was added for high-risk patients as soon as possible after consolidation therapy. We found that mean lumbar spine BMD z score value was -1.75 (0.83) SDS in group 1 and -1.66 (1.21) SDS in group 2. There is no difference between both groups (P = 0.736). The mean BMD z scores of prepubertal and pubertal patients were not significantly different in both groups. Comparison of serum bone turnover parameters of the patients revealed no difference between the two groups. Stepwise regression analysis revealed that lumbar spine BMD z scores was predicted by height SDS and the time past since cessation of therapy, but not age at diagnosis, BMI SDS, cranial radiotherapy, and puberty. Our study results showed that HDMP treatment did not deteriorate the bone mass any more than CDP treatment. These results proved that high-dose steroid therapy over a short period of time in remission-induction treatment would not affect the bone mass any more adversely than would conventional doses approximately 3 years after cessation of chemotherapy.","IncludeStatus":"Exclude","LisedInColA":"No Label","originalFormulation":"No Label","AloneOrComb":"No Label","cancerType":"No Label","studyType":"No Label","therapeuticAssociation":"No Label"},{"id":"422","Drug":"Methylprednisolone","PMID":"9301442","Title":"CHOP-based chemotherapy is as effective as alternating PEEC/CHOP chemotherapy in a randomised trial in high-grade non-Hodgkin\'s lymphoma.

This study was performed using the Japanese nationwide administrative database (Diagnostic Procedure Combination; DPC) in 2012. We employed the propensity score weighting method with a Cox proportional hazards model to compare the mortality between the sivelestat group and the non-sivelestat group. A total of 4276 patients were eligible for this study; 1997 patients were treated with sivelestat and 2279 patients did not receive sivelestat within 7\u2009days of admission.

Other autoantibodies to the nuclear (ANA), RNP, aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (ARS), and signal recognition particle (SRP) were negative. Pathological analysis of the left biceps muscle revealed minimal lymphocytic infiltration into the muscle fibers together with many necrotic and regenerated fibers, which corresponded to necrotizing myopathy. Abdominal CT and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy showed an advanced gastric cancer with lymph node metastasis. The patient was subsequently diagnosed with anti-HMGCR antibody-positive paraneoplastic necrotizing myopathy associated with advanced gastric cancer. The patient underwent radical surgery to remove the cancer and was initially treated with oral prednisolone and intravenous methylprednisolone pulse therapy; however, her symptoms worsened and she became bedridden.

Thus, we favour the use of the low dose regimen in these patients.","IncludeStatus":"Exclude","LisedInColA":"No Label","originalFormulation":"No Label","AloneOrComb":"No Label","cancerType":"No Label","studyType":"No Label","therapeuticAssociation":"No Label"},{"id":"431","Drug":"Methylprednisolone","PMID":"11594518","Title":"Remission of acute myeloblastic leukemia after severe pneumonia treated with high-dose methylprednisolone","Authors":"Shimohakamada Y, Shinohara K, Fukuda N.","Citation":"Int J Hematol. 2001 Aug;74(2):173-7. doi: 10.1007/BF02982001.","CreatedDate":"10/12/01","Abstract":"We report a case of acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML)-M2 (by French-American-British classification) with t(8;21) (q22:q22) that was complicated with severe pneumonia.

This article reviews the pathogenesis and natural history of MS and examines the available treatment options for patients with RRMS, worsening RRMS, or SPMS, with a focus on mitoxantrone. MEDLINE (1966-present) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (1994-present) were searched for relevant randomized, blinded, controlled clinical trials using the terms mitoxantrone, Novantrone, and multiple sclerosis. Five randomized, blinded, controlled trials and an ongoing open-label Phase IV safety study were identified and included in this review. In one randomized, double-blind trial (N=25), patients with RRMS who received mitoxantrone 8 mg/m2 monthly had significantly reduced relapse rates at 1 year compared with those who received placebo (P=0.014). In a 2-year, randomized, partially blinded trial (N=51), patients with active RRMS who received mitoxantrone 8 mg/m2 monthly had significantly fewer relapses compared with those who received placebo (P<0.001), and significantly fewer patients had confirmed progression of disability (1-point increase in Expanded Disability Status Scale [EDSS] score) (P=0.02). In a randomized, double-blind trial (N=49), patients with relapsing SPMS who received mitoxantrone 12 mg/m2 monthly for 3 months followed by 12 mg/m2 g3mo for up to 32 months had significant improvements in EDSS scores compared with those who received methylprednisolone 1 g IV monthly for 3 months followed by 1 g IV g3mo (P=0.002 at 1 year, P=0.045 at 2 years) and significant reductions in the number of gadolinium-enhancing lesions on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (P=0.002 at 1 and 2 years, P=0.03 at 3 years). In a randomized, partially blinded Phase II trial in 42 patients with active RRMS or SPMS, patients who received mitoxantrone 20 mg IV monthly and methylprednisolone 1 g IV monthly had significantly fewer new gadolinium-enhancing lesions on MRI (P<0.001) and significantly fewer relapses (P<0.01) at 6 months compared with those who received methylprednisolone alone. In a pivotal Phase III trial (N=194), patients with worsening RRMS or SPMS who received mitoxantrone 12 mg/m2 g3mo for 2 years had significantly fewer relapses (P<0.001) and significantly less deterioration in disability, as measured by change in EDSS score (P=0.019), compared with those who received placebo. In a nonrandomized subgroup of patients from this study (n=110), those who received mitoxantrone 12 mg/m2 g3mo had a significant reduction in the number of T2-weighted MRI lesions at 24 months (P=0.027). The most common adverse events in these studies included nausea and/or vomiting (18%-85%), alopecia (33%-61%), amenorrhea (8%-53%), urinary tract infections (6%-32%), and upper respiratory tract infections (4%-53%). Leukopenia was reported in 10% to 19% of patients. Use of mitoxantrone can lead to serious adverse effects, particularly cardiotoxicity, myelosuppression, and, rarely, leukemia. Long-term use of mitoxantrone may compromise left ventricular function. Limited cardiotoxicity was reported in the clinical studies; in the pivotal clinical trial, 2 patients who received mitoxantrone 12 mg/m2 had decreases in left ventricular ejection fraction to <50% of baseline. In the available clinical trials, mitoxantrone provided effective treatment for worsening RRMS or SPMS. When mitoxantrone is used as recommended, the risks of substantial myelosuppressive and cardiotoxic effects can be reduced by careful patient selection, drug administration, and monitoring. The lifetime cumulative dose should be strictly limited to 140 mg/m2, or 2 to 3 years of therapy.","IncludeStatus":"Exclude","LisedInColA":"No Label","originalFormulation":"No Label","AloneOrComb":"No Label","cancerType":"No Label","studyType":"No Label","therapeuticAssociation":"No Label"},{"id":"433","Drug":"Methylprednisolone","PMID":"9020370","Title":"High-dose methylprednisolone for children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and unfavorable presenting features","Authors":"Hi\u221a\xdfs\u221a\u2202nmez G, G\u221a\xbamr\u221a\xbak F, Zamani PV, Tuncer MA, Yetgin S, G\u221a\xbargey A, Atahan L, Ozsoylu S.","Citation":"Eur J Haematol. 1997 Jan;58(1):26-31. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.1997.tb01406.x.","CreatedDate":"1/1/97","Abstract":"In an attempt to improve treatment outcome high-dose methylprednisolone (HDMP, 20-30 mg/kg, once a day orally) was used instead of a conventional dose of steroid (2 mg/kg/d, in 3 divided doses) in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) with increased risk factors. HDMP combined with cytotoxic agents (vincristine and L-asparaginase) resulted in an improved complete remission rate (94%) in 48 newly diagnosed children with ALL compared to 81% in 86 historical controls receiving standard dose steroid combined with the same treatment regimen. The bone marrow relapse rate was lower in patients who received HDMP (31%) than in controls (56%). Treatment was discontinued in 56% of 48 patients receiving HDMP and in 35% of 86 controls.

Little is known about salvage treatment for refractory cases. A 63-year-old man who had been diagnosed with stage I seminoma and undergone a high orchiectomy 1 year previously developed swelling of his left iliac lymph node and was diagnosed with a recurrence of the seminoma. He was administered a standard chemotherapy regimen of cisplatin, etoposide, and bleomycin. At the end of second cycle, he developed a dry cough and fever that was accompanied by newly-identified bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray. Despite initiation of oral prednisolone, his exertional dyspnea and decline in pulmonary functions continued to be aggravated. High-dose pulse treatment with methylprednisolone was introduced and improved his symptoms and radiologic findings. However, the maintenance dose of oral prednisolone allowed reactivation of the disease with evidence of newly-developed bilateral lung opacities on high-resolution CT scans. Considering his glucose intolerance and cataracts as complications of corticosteroid treatment, administration of pirfenidone was initiated with the patient\'s consent. Pirfenidone at 1800\xa0mg/day was well tolerated, and resolved his symptoms and abnormal opacities on a chest CT scan. Subsequently, the dose of prednisolone was gradually tapered without worsening of the disease. At the most recent follow-up, he was still in complete remission of seminoma with a successfully tapered combination dose of prednisolone and pirfenidone. Pirfenidone, a novel oral agent with anti-inflammatory and -fibrotic properties, should be considered as a salvage drug for refractory cases of bleomycin-induced lung injury.","IncludeStatus":"Exclude","LisedInColA":"No Label","originalFormulation":"No Label","AloneOrComb":"No Label","cancerType":"No Label","studyType":"No Label","therapeuticAssociation":"No Label"},{"id":"436","Drug":"Methylprednisolone","PMID":"2693621","Title":"Methylprednisolone versus metoclopramide as antiemetic treatment in patients receiving adjuvant cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, 5-fluorouracil (CMF) chemotherapy: a randomized crossover blind study","Authors":"Gez E, Sulkes A, Ochayon L, Gera C, Nathan S, Cass Y, Rubello E, Biran S.","Citation":"J Chemother. 1989 Dec;1(6):365-8. doi: 10.1080/1120009x.1989.11738924.","CreatedDate":"12/1/89","Abstract":"Nineteen women receiving their first cycle of adjuvant chemotherapy for early breast cancer were randomized between two antiemetic drugs: methylprednisolone (MPN) 125mg and metoclopramide (MCP) 20mg, both given by intravenous push as a single dose.

There were no statistically significant differences in failure-free survival or emesis-free survival among the three methylprednisolone dose levels. Both failure-free survival and emesis-free survival were significantly superior in the three methylprednisolone arms than in the placebo group (p<0.05 to p<0.01).

Also present were productive cough and perianal itching. The diagnosis was determined from lymph node and perianal skin biopsies. Furthermore, by a typical finding on HRCT (high-resolution computed tomography), pulmonary involvement was confirmed the gradual development of which we succeeded to document through a series of several HRCT and PET/CT scans from its initial florid phase characterized by disseminated nodularities up to the terminal phase with the decline of activity and development of cystic formations. After the collection of peripheral blood stem cells, the planned patient\'s therapy started which in all consisted of three monotherapy cycles with cladribine followed by three cycles of combined chemotherapy (cladribine + cyclophosphamide + methylprednisolone) and complemented with curative radiotherapy of the perianal area. This treatment put the disease into complete remission. However, in two months the initial B-symptoms occurred again, along with the pulmonary symptomatology, perianal pruritus and newly also hip bone pains. The suspected LCH relapse was proved histologically by lymph node biopsy and confirmed at a restaging PET/CT examination which also showed disease dissemination into the hip bones. Consequently, an aggressive form of the disease with early relapse had been the case, which was indicated for administering 4 cycles of CHOEP (cyclophosphamide + doxorubicin + vincristine + etoposide + prednisone) as salvage regimen completed in March 2010 with autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation after high-dose BEAM (carmustine + etoposide + cytarabine + melphalan) chemotherapy. Thus, the generalized involvement of nodes doesn\'t always need to be malignant lymphoma or metastatic dissemination of a tumour but also LCH may be the case. The presence of B symptoms may very likely stand for an aggressive form of the disease course. Histological evaluation of the proliferative characteristic (given by Ki-67 immunohistochemical proliferative index marker and also morphologically by the number of mitosis) may draw attention to an aggressive form of this disease. However, therapy with cladribine (2-chlorodeoxyadenosine) which proves beneficial in classic forms of LCH, in cases of highly aggressive forms of LCH doesn\'t need to have the same effect as in LCH with low proliferative activity, which conforms to the present experience in the treatment of indolent and aggressive lymphomas. In our study, the hybrid PET/CT imaging proved high sensitivity in evaluating the activity of the disease, including its early relapse.

Unresolved right shoulder pain manifesting as the first clinical presentation of carcinoid tumor with unknown primary origin is a rare clinical entity. To the best of our knowledge, herein we present the first case report describing metastasis to the right shoulder joint in a patient who presented with bone pain as the first clinical manifestation of metastatic carcinoid tumor of unknown primary origin. Metastasis to the right scapula as the first presentation of an underlying carcinoid tumor in the primary bronchus has been reported previously. A 72-year-old Caucasian woman presented with pain in her right shoulder after a fall. She delayed seeking medical attention for 4 weeks for personal reasons. Her physical examination revealed no erythema or swelling of the right shoulder. However, tenderness was noted on the right subacromial bursa and the right acromioclavicular joint. Her drop arm test was positive. An X-ray of the right upper extremity showed no fracture. She did not respond to methylprednisolone injections or physical therapy. Because of the unresolved right shoulder pain with disturbance of her daily activities, magnetic resonance imaging of the right shoulder was ordered, which revealed permeative destruction of the right scapula. Because the permeative destruction of the bone could have been an osteolytic malignant feature, positron emission tomography-computed tomography was performed, which produced a scan showing osseous metastasis to the right scapula, multiple liver metastases and a 1.7 cm right-lower-lobe pulmonary nodule. Her serotonin and chromogranin A levels were significantly elevated. The patient was treated with palliative cisplatin and etoposide chemotherapy followed by locoregional treatments for metastatic carcinoid tumor. She had mild improvement in her right shoulder pain, as well as better range of motion and improved quality of life, before she died less than 2 years after her diagnosis. Our present case report emphasizes the protean manifestations of carcinoid tumors with the importance of early diagnosis of bone metastases from these tumors, because early diagnosis plays a major role in choosing the therapeutic regimen and prognosticating the course of the disease. The treatment goals for high-grade, poorly differentiated carcinoid tumors of unknown origin are decreasing the tumor load while controlling symptoms with chemotherapy and local modality treatments.","IncludeStatus":"Include","LisedInColA":"No","originalFormulation":"Yes","AloneOrComb":"Combination","cancerType":"Don\'t know","studyType":"Clinical case report","therapeuticAssociation":"Inconclusive"},{"id":"456","Drug":"Methylprednisolone","PMID":"29794751","Title":"Pulmonary adenocarcinoma associated with Guillain-Barr\u221a\xa9 syndrome: A case report","Authors":"Wang Y, Yang S, Fang L, Liu Y, Jiang G, Ding X, Wei H, Liu M.","Citation":"Medicine (Baltimore). 2018 May;97(21):e10737. doi: 10.1097/MD.0000000000010737.","CreatedDate":"5/26/18","Abstract":"Guillain-Barr\xe9 Syndrome (GBS) as a paraneoplastic manifestation of small cell lung cancer has been published several times, while paraneoplastic GBS accompanied by pulmonary adenocarcinoma is rare.

The International Prognostic Index (IPI) was recently developed to predict patient survival on the basis of pretreatment clinical features. However, classical multivariate regression models such as the IPI fail to detect time-dependent changes in the predictive value of covariates. In this study, an extension of the Cox proportional hazards model was used to determine whether the value of prognostic factors might decay over time. A total of 1271 patients younger than 60 years, entered on the LNH-84 and LNH-87 studies of an ACVBP induction regimen (consisting of doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vindesine, bleomycin, methylprednisolone, and IT methotrexate), were analyzed in terms of overall survival and monthly risk of dying. By a standard method, prognostic factors were identified in a training sample and confirmed in a validation sample. The independently significant covariates were then included in a step-function regression model (3-step) that permitted determination of their value in predicting the short term and long term survival of the entire population. During the entire follow-up period (median, 5.5 years), lactate dehydrogenase level, tumor stage, performance status, and number of extranodal sites remained independently predictive of overall survival. However, these covariates had nonproportional hazard functions. The study of their time-dependent effect with the 3-step model confirmed that they were predictive of overall survival during the short term follow-up period of 3 months to 2 years. However, during the induction period of 0-3 months and the long term follow-up period of 2-10 years, there was only 1 independently predictive factor for each of these periods: performance status and tumor stage, respectively. The IPI factors are relevant to short term follow-up and permit the selection of routine or experimental therapeutic regimens. In contrast, only performance status is predictive of a patient\'s ability to tolerate induction chemotherapy, and only tumor stage is predictive of long term survival.","IncludeStatus":"Exclude","LisedInColA":"No Label","originalFormulation":"No Label","AloneOrComb":"No Label","cancerType":"No Label","studyType":"No Label","therapeuticAssociation":"No Label"},{"id":"459","Drug":"Methylprednisolone","PMID":"9748876","Title":"[Treatment of multiple myeloma with high-dose chemotherapy and transplantation of autologous hematopoietic stem cells and subsequent maintenance therapy with interferon alfa-2b or interferon alfa 2b and dexamethasone.

The aim of this project was to retrospectively assess efficacy and safety of high-dose dexamethasone combined with rituximab (R-dex) in this setting. We treated 54 patients (pts) with relapsed/refractory CLL using R-dex regimen at two tertiary centers. Two schedules of rituximab were used (not randomized - based on the choice of the center): group 1, rituximab 500 mg/m(2)day 1, 8, 15, 22 (375 mg/m(2) in 1st dose) every 4 weeks (n=29); group 2, 500 mg/m(2)day 1 (375 mg/m(2) in 1st cycle) repeated every 3 weeks (n=25). The target dose of dexamethasone was 40 mg on days 1-4 and 10-13 or 15-18. Rai III/IV stages were present in 82%, unmutated IgVH genes in 82%, del 11q in 38% and del 17p in 19% pts; 46% had bulky lymph nodes; 82% were pretreated with fludarabine and 29% with alemtuzumab. Overall response rate/complete remissions were 62/21% (Group 1) and 72/4% (Group 2). In three patients, R-dex was successfully used for debulking before nonmyeloablative allogeneic stem cell transplantation. R-dex was particularly effective in improvement of anemia and thrombocytopenia (p=0.0055 and p=0.0036); B-symptoms resolved after treatment in 11/17 pts. Hematological toxicity was mild. Serious infections occurred in 32% pts. At the median follow-up of 9 and 10 months, median progression-free survival was 6 months in Group 1 and 6.9 months in Group 2 (p=ns); median overall survival was 14.1 months in Group 1 vs. not reached in Group 2 (p=ns). R-dex appears to be an active and feasible treatment for relapsed/refractory CLL. Infectious toxicity remains an important issue.

To date, only OKT3 has demonstrated consistent efficacy in reversing rejection crisis. From 1989 to 1993, a phase II trial comparing the mAb T10B9.1A31 (T10B9) with OKT3 for treatment of acute cellular rejection in renal allograft recipients was done at the University of Kentucky. We collected data from 178 patients potentially eligible to enter the study; 48 never rejected, 9 refused, 13 could not be biopsied, 16 received methylprednisolone, and 11 received antithymocyte globulin or OKT3. Altogether, 81 patients entered the study, 76 of whom were able to be evaluated. Patients with biopsy-confirmed acute rejection were randomly assigned to T10B9 or OKT3 for at least 10 days. Demographically, there was no difference between the T10B9 or OKT3 cohorts. Actuarial graft survival at 4 years was 87% for patients receiving T10B9, 79% for those receiving OKT3, and 89% for those receiving both mAbs (P=0.55). Patient survival at 4 years was 94% for T10B9, 100% for OKT3, and 89% for both mAbs (P=0.45). Mean creatinines of the cohorts were no different at 1, 6, 12, 24, and 36 months. There was less cytokine nephropathy (P<0.001) observed in patients receiving T10B9. Untoward gastrointestinal, neurological, respiratory, and febrile effects were significantly more frequent in the OKT3 cohort after the first dose (day 0) and with later (day 1-9) administration. Cytokine levels (tumor necrosis factor alpha and interferon gamma) measured 2 hr after the first dose were three to six times higher in patients treated with OKT3 than in those treated with T10B9 (P<0.005). Infectious complications were not significantly different, although serious infections occurred only in patients receiving OKT3. No cases of posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder were seen in either cohort. Human anti-mouse antibody development was as follows: titer 1:100, 30% T10B9, 42% OKT3; titer 1:1000, 3% T10B9, 3% OKT3. There was no cross-reactivity with OKT3 in patients treated with T10B9, and there was only 9.7% cross-reactivity to T10B9 in patients treated with OKT3. T10B9 provides treatment for renal allograft acute cellular rejection as effective as that of OKT3 with fewer untoward effects, less cytokine release and nephropathy, fewer serious infections, and without increased development of human anti-mouse antibody. The lack of cross-reactivity offers an alternative therapy should the first mAb fail or re-rejection occur. A phase III trial should be initiated in renal allograft recipients, and phase I and phase II trials should be initiated in other solid-organ transplantations.","IncludeStatus":"Exclude","LisedInColA":"No Label","originalFormulation":"No Label","AloneOrComb":"No Label","cancerType":"No Label","studyType":"No Label","therapeuticAssociation":"No Label"},{"id":"464","Drug":"Methylprednisolone","PMID":"8560602","Title":"The effect of high-dose methylprednisolone on CD34-positive bone marrow cells in the children with acute myeloblastic leukemia","Authors":"Tuncer AM, Hi\u221a\xdfs\u221a\u2202nmez G, G\u221a\xbamr\u221a\xbak F, Albayrak D, Duru F, G\u221a\xbazel E, Sayli T.","Citation":"Turk J Pediatr. 1995 Oct-Dec;37(4):345-9.","CreatedDate":"10/1/95","Abstract":"The expression of CD34 antigen on the surface of bone marrow (BM) cells during remission induction was studied in 20 patients with CD34-negative acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML).

We aimed to determine whether systemic steroids are efficacious in proliferating hemangioma and to compare the efficacy and safety of 2 corticosteroid treatment modalities. Twenty patients with problematic hemangiomas of infancy were randomly assigned to either daily oral prednisolone or monthly intravenous pulses of methylprednisolone. Their clinical outcomes (improvement using a visual analog score) and adverse events were compared at 3 months from baseline and 1 year of age. Data on possible surrogate markers of angiogenesis were available for the first 3 months. At 3 months, orally treated patients had a median visual analog score of 70 compared with 12 in the intravenous group. This response pattern was similar at the patients\' first birthday: 50.0 vs -1.5. Additional treatment beyond 3 months was needed for 65% of the patients (7 in the intravenous and 6 in the oral group). Six of 8 patients with impaired vision at enrollment had an improved function at 1 year (4 patients in the intravenous group and 3 patients in the oral group). Of the 4 surrogate markers of angiogenesis measured (plasma basic fibroblast growth factor, vascular endothelial growth factor, vascular cellular adhesion molecule 1, endoglin, and urine basic fibroblast growth factor), the only 2 that decreased over time were vascular cellular adhesion molecule 1 and endoglin. Patients in the oral group had a higher rate of adverse effects, such as hypertension (18.6% vs 13.1%), abnormal cortisol (78% vs 60%), and growth retardation. Systemic corticosteroids are efficacious in stopping the proliferation of hemangiomas. The oral corticosteroids offered more clinical and biological benefit than the pulse steroids with higher risk of adverse effects.","IncludeStatus":"Exclude","LisedInColA":"No Label","originalFormulation":"No Label","AloneOrComb":"No Label","cancerType":"No Label","studyType":"No Label","therapeuticAssociation":"No Label"},{"id":"472","Drug":"Methylprednisolone","PMID":"12804646","Title":"2-deoxycoformycin in the treatment of T-large granular lymphocyte leukemia","Authors":"Tsirigotis P, Venetis E, Kapsimali V, Rontogianni D, Varvitsioti E, Pappa V, Apostolidis P.","Citation":"Leuk Res. 2003 Sep;27(9):865-7. doi: 10.1016/s0145-2126(03)00019-5.","CreatedDate":"6/14/03","Abstract":"A 52-year-old woman presented to our clinic for investigation of agranulocytosis and mild lymphocytosis.

Treatment consisted of 3 cycles of ESHAP; responsive patients (pts) then received 3 more cycles, and IC+HCT was used for pts in maintained partial (PR) or complete (CR) remission after the sixth ESHAP. Sixty-five pts entered the study. At enrollment, 27 pts had bone marrow (BM) and/or central nervous system (CNS) lymphomatous infiltration. Disease status was primary refractory lymphoma in 41 pts (63 %), and relapse in 24 pts (37 %). Results showed that two pts were not evaluable for the therapeutic response because of early treatment-related death. Thirty-nine (62 %) pts entered PR or CR after 3 cycles of ESHAP. Eleven pts subsequently had disease progression. Twenty-eight pts were in persistent CR or PR after 6 cycles of ESHAP. Refractory pts did not show a different response rate to relapsing pts (chi2= 1.73). Five pts were excluded from IC+HCT because of an inadequate graft or treatment-related toxicity. Twenty-three (35 %) pts completed the procedure. Five pts (22 %) relapsed after IC+HCT. The overall survival rate of the 39 responsive pts is 45 % at 60 months, with a median survival time of 30 months.

Despite the poor prognostic features of this group, 45% of pts responding to the first 3 cycles of chemotherapy are in prolonged remission, suggesting that rather than to transplant after just 2 cycles of salvage therapy, pursuing second-line chemotherapy may better discriminate between patients more likely to benefit from a subsequent transplant.","IncludeStatus":"Include","LisedInColA":"Yes","originalFormulation":"Yes","AloneOrComb":"Combination","cancerType":"Lymphoid","studyType":"Clinical trial","therapeuticAssociation":"No effect"},{"id":"474","Drug":"Methylprednisolone","PMID":"15983554","Title":"Engraftment syndrome after nonmyeloablative allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation: incidence and effects on survival","Authors":"Gorak E, Geller N, Srinivasan R, Espinoza-Delgado I, Donohue T, Barrett AJ, Suffredini A, Childs R.","Citation":"Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2005 Jul;11(7):542-50. doi: 10.1016/j.bbmt.2005.04.009.","CreatedDate":"6/29/05","Abstract":"Engraftment syndrome (ES) encompasses a constellation of symptoms that occur during neutrophil recovery after both autologous and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT). Although it is well characterized after conventional myeloablative procedures, limited data exist on this complication after nonmyeloablative allogeneic HCT. The clinical manifestations, incidence, and risk factors associated with ES were investigated in a consecutive series of patients undergoing cyclophosphamide/fludarabine-based nonmyeloablative allogeneic HCT from a related HLA-compatible donor. Fifteen (10%) of 149 patients (median age, 53 years; range, 27-66 years) developed ES; the onset of symptoms occurred at a median of 10 days (range, 3-14 days), and they consisted of fever (100%), cough (53%), diffuse pulmonary infiltrates (100%), rash (13%), and room air hypoxia (87%). ES was more likely to develop in patients who received empiric amphotericin formulations after transplant conditioning (Fisher exact test; P=.007). In a multivariate analysis, older patient age, female sex, and treatment with amphotericin were predictors for the development of ES. Intravenous methylprednisolone led to the rapid resolution of ES; however, transplant-related mortality was significantly higher (cumulative incidence, 49% versus 16%; P=.0005), and median survival was significantly shorter (168 versus 418 days; P=.005) in patients with ES compared with non-ES patients. In conclusion, ES occurs commonly after cyclophosphamide/fludarabine-based nonmyeloablative transplantation and responds rapidly to corticosteroid treatment, but it is associated with a higher risk of nonrelapse mortality and with shorter overall survival.","IncludeStatus":"Exclude","LisedInColA":"No Label","originalFormulation":"No Label","AloneOrComb":"No Label","cancerType":"No Label","studyType":"No Label","therapeuticAssociation":"No Label"},{"id":"475","Drug":"Methylprednisolone","PMID":"12225393","Title":"A prospective study of P-IMVP-16/CBDCA: a novel salvage chemotherapy for patients with aggressive non-Hodgkin\'s lymphoma who had previously received CHOP therapy as first-line chemotherapy","Authors":"Sawada M, Tsurumi H, Yamada T, Hara T, Fukuno K, Goto H, Shimizu M, Kasahara S, Yoshikawa T, Kanemura N, Oyama M, Takami T, Moriwaki H.","Citation":"Eur J Haematol. 2002 Jun;68(6):354-61. doi: 10.1034/j.1600-0609.2002.01654.x.","CreatedDate":"9/13/02","Abstract":"The purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy of salvage chemotherapy with, P-IMVP-16/CBDCA, consisting of carboplatin (CBDCA), etoposide (VP-16), ifosfamide (IFM), and methotrexate (MTX), for patients with aggressive non-Hodgkin\'s lymphoma (NHL) who had previously received CHOP [a regimen of cyclophosphamide, hydroxydaunomycin, Oncovin (vincristine), and prednisolone], as first-line chemotherapy.

We present the case of a patient who experienced two episodes of systemic capillary leak syndrome and pulmonary hypertension; the first after gemcitabine in an adjuvant setting and the second three years later after treatment with nab-paclitaxel for metastatic disease. A 65-year-old patient underwent a pancreatectomy in January 2010 for ductal carcinoma (pT3 N0 M0, stage IIa), followed by adjuvant chemotherapy. Seven days after the last cycle, she developed dyspnea associated with orthopnea and cough. A transthoracic cardiac ecocolordoppler was performed, with evidence of pulmonary hypertension (58 mmHg). Blood tests showed an increase in creatinine, pro-BNP and D-Dimer. She began high-dose diuretic therapy combined with cortisone. After a month, the patient was eupneic and the anasarca had resolved. We decided gradually to reduce the steroid and diuretic therapy. After ten days of the reduction, the patient began to re-present the same symptoms after treatment with gemcitabine. Corticosteroid therapy was restored with rapid clinical benefit and decreased pro-BNP after a week of treatment. After two years, the disease returned. As a first line treatment, it was decided to use nab-paclitaxel 100 mg/m2 weekly. After two doses, followed by approximately 14 days of treatment, the patient developed acute respiratory distress syndrome. The clinical suspicion was a relapse of capillary leak syndrome and treatment with a high-dose diuretic (furosemide 250 mg daily) was started combined with cortisone (40 mg methylprednisolone). The patient showed a progressive clinical benefit. In patients treated with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel who experience a sudden onset of diffuse edema with respiratory distress, capillary leak syndrome should be suspected.

All patients were premedicated, prior to each course, with methylprednisolone per os. Forty-one patients entered the study. Thirty-nine were assessable for response and 40 for toxicity. Objective responses were seen in 10 patients (24% of the eligible; 95% CI = 12.4-40.3%, 26% of the assessable and 28% of patients with cerebral metastases were excluded). Three of them achieved a complete response (7%; 95% CI = 1.5-19.9) and 7 a partial response (17%; 95% CI = 7.1-32.0), while 8 patients demonstrated stabilization of their disease (20%; 95% CI = 8.8-34.9). After a median follow-up of 20 months, the median time to progression was 7 months (range 0.5-22) and the median survival was 10 months (1-24+). The main toxicity (G3-4) was neutropenia which occurred in 8/40 (20%) patients. Additional patients had reversible G3-4 toxicities including alopecia, nausea and vomiting and fatigue; 3 of them presented mild to moderate hypersensitivity reactions to docetaxel. No toxic death was noted. The combination of docetaxel and DTIC is active and well tolerated in patients with advanced melanoma.

The major toxic effect of this regimen was bone marrow suppression. Two patients were excluded from this study in the first course because of severe hematologic toxicity. The renal toxicity of this regimen was minimal and no patients developed any clinical problem. Nausea and vomiting during the treatment were well controlled by high-dose metoclopramide and methylprednisolone. In conclusion, this combination of chemotherapy is effective for patients with small cell lung cancer.

However, OLT has significant, theoretical advantage that it removes both the tumor and the organ that is at a risk of malignancy. The Japanese law on organ transplantation limited the availability of cadaveric liver donors until its revision on July 17, 2011. ABO-incompatible OLT was formerly contraindicated because performed anti-A/B antibodies on recipient endothelial cells raised the risk of antibody-mediated humoral graft rejection. We have herein described four successful cases of steroid withdrawal among adult patients who underwent living donor OLT from ABO-incompatible donors. In addition, we transplanted a liver from a living donor into an ABO-incompatible recipient on August 9, 2004. The 55-year-old man with HCC due to hepatitis B virus (HBV) a cirrhosis had a Child-Pugh score of C, and Model for End-stage Liver Disease score of 22. Two tumors greater than 5 cm, exceeded the Milan criteria. His des-gamma-carboxy prothrombin level was 6 mAu/mL, and alpha-fetoprotein, 18.78 ng/mL. Antirejection therapy included multiple perioperative plasmaphereses and splenectomy; with an immunosuppressive regimen consisting of tacrolimus, methylprednisolone, and mycophenolate mofetil. The maintenance dose of immunosuppression did not differ from that of ABO-identical cases. After transplantation, we used intrahepatic arterial infusion therapy with prostaglandin E1 (PG E1). The patient had complications of portal vein thrombosis, hepatic artery thrombosis, and acute myocardial infarction, which were treated by interventional radiology in the posttransplantation period. We controlled the HBsAb titer by administering hepatitis B immunoglobulin and lamivudine (200 IU/L doses) for 1 year after OLT and 100 IU/L doses thereafter. As a result, the patient achieved long-term, disease-free graft survival without steroids. He currently has good liver function and leads a normal lifestyle. Our results suggested the feasibility of controlling antibody-mediated humoral rejection and other complications in living donor liver transplantations into ABO-incompatible adults via intrahepatic arterial PG E1 infusion splenectomy, and plasmapheresis with regular immunosuppression. Withdrawal of steroids, HBV vaccination, and lamivudine, an nucleoside analog reverse transcriptase inhibitor, have achieved long-term (7 years) survival without recurrent HBV infection or tumor.","IncludeStatus":"Exclude","LisedInColA":"No Label","originalFormulation":"No Label","AloneOrComb":"No Label","cancerType":"No Label","studyType":"No Label","therapeuticAssociation":"No Label"},{"id":"488","Drug":"Methylprednisolone","PMID":"20229072","Title":"Effect of preoperative single-dose corticosteroid administration on postoperative morbidity following esophagectomy","Authors":"Engelman E, Maeyens C.","Citation":"J Gastrointest Surg. 2010 May;14(5):788-804. doi: 10.1007/s11605-010-1168-0.

Response and survival rates were similar in patients with low-grade (n = 34), intermediate-grade (n = 67), transformed (n = 18), and high-grade (n = 3) lymphoma. The most significant factors for response and survival by multivariate analysis were the serum lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) level, tumor burden, and age (when analyzed as a continuous variable), while prior CR was highly significant by univariate analysis. A significant difference in survival was noted for patients with normal LDH levels and low- or intermediate-tumor burden or patients with low tumor burden and elevated LDH levels (55% 3-year survival rate) versus patients with elevated LDH levels and intermediate or high tumor burden (< 20%). Major toxicities included myelosuppression, with a median granulocyte count of 500/microL and platelet count of 70,000/microL.

Electrocardiography indicated a complete A-V block, and chest radiography (CXR) showed a reticular shadow in both lower lung fields and bilateral pleural effusion. Chest computed tomography (CT) indicated subpleural emphysematous changes, multiple nodules, consolidation shadow with ground glass opacity in both lower lobes, and bilateral pleural effusion.

We conducted a randomized, double-blinded, 7 arm clinical trial to: (1) identify the presence of a dose-response for complete protection from emesis, and (2) compare batanopride with a standard antiemetic, methylprednisolone if a dose-response was found not to exist. Prior to chemotherapy, six patient groups each received a single intravenous dose of batanopride ranging from 0.2 to 6.0 mg/kg whereas a seventh group received methylprednisolone 250 mg intravenously.

In addition to standard diagnostics, we performed metabolic investigations using proton magnet resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS). We describe the case of a non-limbic anti-NMDAR encephalitis with a long course of disease (21 months). Laboratory diagnostics showed antibodies against NMDAR; an MRI revealed unspecific findings. (1)H-MRS indicated a hypoglutamatergic state in the left prefrontal cortex associated with a left hemispherical hypometabolism on FDG-PET. Despite the long course of disease, immunosuppressive therapy with methylprednisolone and azathioprine led to almost complete remission of clinical symptoms. Clinical improvement developed in parallel with remarkable normalization of cerebral glucose metabolism on FDG-PET. This case of long-lasting extra-limbic anti-NMDAR encephalitis is of high clinical relevance. First, it illustrates that a very good outcome is possible even if adequate therapy is started only 21 months after the onset of severe symptoms. Second, it provides valuable insights into the pathophysiology of such anti-NMDAR encephalitis; these insights prove that anti-NMDAR encephalitis is linked not only to hyperglutamatergic signals but also to hypoglutamatergic states. These findings, contradictory at first glance, can be integrated within the model of excitatory/inhibitory imbalance and local area network inhibition.","IncludeStatus":"Exclude","LisedInColA":"No Label","originalFormulation":"No Label","AloneOrComb":"No Label","cancerType":"No Label","studyType":"No Label","therapeuticAssociation":"No Label"},{"id":"520","Drug":"Methylprednisolone","PMID":"7543720","Title":"Methylprednisolone in advanced chronic lymphocytic leukaemia: rationale for, and effectiveness of treatment suggested by DiSC assay","Authors":"Bosanquet AG, McCann SR, Crotty GM, Mills MJ, Catovsky D.","Citation":"Acta Haematol. 1995;93(2-4):73-9. doi: 10.1159/000204115.","CreatedDate":"1/1/95","Abstract":"The effect of methylprednisolone on fresh cells from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) has been studied using the differential staining cytotoxicity (DiSC) assay resulting in LC90s of < or = 0.2 to 2,000 micrograms/ml.

Here, we present the final analysis of the study. The treatment regimen consisted of four to six cycles of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone followed by mobilizing therapy with either the dexamethasone, carmustine, melphalan, etoposide, and cytarabine protocol or the etoposide, methylprednisolone, cytarabine, and cisplatin protocol and stem-cell collection. Patients in complete remission (CR) or partial remission (PR) underwent myeloablative chemoradiotherapy (fractionated total-body irradiation and high-dose cyclophosphamide) and autoSCT. From June 2000 to April 2006, 83 patients were enrolled onto the study. Main subgroups were PTCL not specified (n = 32) and angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (n = 27). Fifty-five (66%) of the 83 patients received transplantation. The main reason for not receiving autoSCT was progressive disease. In an intent-to-treat analysis, the overall response rate after myeloablative therapy was 66% (56% CR and 8% PR). With a median follow-up time of 33 months, 43 patients are alive; the estimated 3-year overall and disease-free survival rates for patients in CR (calculated from CR to the date of relapse) and 3-year progression-free survival rate were 48%, 53%, and 36%, respectively. The results of this prospective study suggest a substantial impact on outcome for upfront autoSCT in PTCL and should be further evaluated in randomized trials.

This was a retrospective observational study. Six newly diagnosed patients with MPA were initially treated with methylprednisolone and a single dose of RTX (375 mg/m<sup>2</sup>). We investigated the patients\' clinical features, as well as the efficacy and safety of RTX treatment. All patients attained remission on a tapered prednisolone dose of < 10 mg/day during the first 12 months. One patient relapsed after 12 months whereas another required hospitalization owing to infective spondyloarthritis. Adverse reactions to RTX infusion and late-onset neutropenia were not observed. Therefore, a single-dose treatment with RTX induced remission with few complications, and allowed tapering the prednisolone treatment.

Corticosteroids are the mainstay for most high-grade immune-related adverse events (irAEs) such as pembrolizumab-induced hepatitis. However, the dose and duration of corticosteroid therapy are not well defined. The objective of this case report was to describe a new treatment pattern for severe immune checkpoint inhibitor-associated hepatitis. Here, we report the case of a patient with metastatic lung adenocarcinoma who developed grade 3 immunotherapy-induced hepatitis after the first cycle of pembrolizumab. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels peaked at 233 U/L. Hepatitis was alleviated after the administration of methylprednisolone. Therefore, we retreated the patient with pembrolizumab. However, aminotransferase levels increased again after the initiation of low-dose methylprednisolone or the reuse of pembrolizumab. Finally, hepatitis was controlled with low-dose methylprednisolone plus bicyclol, a Chinese hepatoprotective agent. Although the patient had been on low-dose methylprednisolone therapy for about six months, he showed a prompt response. During this period, we also found a dramatic decrease in the neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), senescent T cells (CD8<sup>+</sup> CD28<sup>-</sup> CD57<sup>+</sup> ), and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) in the peripheral blood of the patient. To our knowledge, this is the first case report of successful management of grade 3 pembrolizumab-induced hepatitis with a combination of low-dose corticosteroids and bicyclol. The durable clinical response and changes in blood biomarkers indicate that low doses of corticosteroids do not compromise the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). Therefore, this case may provide a new treatment pattern for severe immunotherapy-induced hepatitis.","IncludeStatus":"Exclude","LisedInColA":"No Label","originalFormulation":"No Label","AloneOrComb":"No Label","cancerType":"No Label","studyType":"No Label","therapeuticAssociation":"No Label"},{"id":"526","Drug":"Methylprednisolone","PMID":"9127135","Title":"Combination effect of granisetron and methylprednisolone for preventing emesis induced by cytotoxic agents","Authors":"Kigawa J, Minagawa Y, Itamochi H, Cheng X, Okada M, Terakawa N.","Citation":"Gynecol Obstet Invest. 1997;43(3):195-9. doi: 10.1159/000291853.","CreatedDate":"1/1/97","Abstract":"To evaluate the combined effect of granisetron and methylprednisolone against acute emesis induced by cytotoxic agents, we investigated the clinical response and the urinary excretion of 5-HIAA in 85 patients with ovarian cancer who received the same anticancer chemotherapeutic regimen in a prospective randomized trial.

By reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis, we found predominant expression of mRNA for MIP-1alpha in addition to those for receptor-activator of nuclear-factor kappa B ligand (RANKL), TNF-alpha, and IL-6 in lymphoma cells obtained from the patient. Furthermore, recombinant MIP-1alpha significantly stimulated (3)H-thymidine uptake by isolated MCL cells in vitro. Treatment with intravenous fluids, bisphosphonate, and methylprednisolone followed by combination chemotherapy promptly corrects the hypercalcemia and successfully induced complete remission, which was accompanied by a decrease of these cytokines in the serum, including MIP-1alpha. In the present case, MIP-1alpha, an osteoclast-activating factor produced by mantle lymphoma cells, may contribute to the development of hypercalcemia. It likely acts through RANKL expression in tumor cells and/or stroma cells, as indicated in multiple myeloma (MM) and adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL). Furthermore, MIP-1alpha is also involved in the development of an aggressive phenotype on MCL by stimulating proliferation of these lymphoma cells. In summary, the present study demonstrated that MIP-1alpha is an important factor in the development of both hypercalcemia and an aggressive phenotype in some types of B-cell lymphoma.","IncludeStatus":"Include","LisedInColA":"Yes","originalFormulation":"Yes","AloneOrComb":"Combination","cancerType":"Lymphoid","studyType":"Clinical case report","therapeuticAssociation":"Effective"},{"id":"530","Drug":"Methylprednisolone","PMID":"8583246","Title":"Evaluation of response to postradiation eight in one chemotherapy in childhood brain tumors","Authors":"Ayan I, Darendeliler E, Kebudi R, Barlas O, Ayan N, Bayindir C, Bahar S, Bilge N.","Citation":"J Neurooncol. 1995 Oct;26(1):65-72. doi: 10.1007/BF01054770.","CreatedDate":"10/1/95","Abstract":"Ten children, 3 to 15 years of age with high risk primary brain tumors were treated with postradiation \'eight in one\' chemotherapy; vincristine, lomustine, procarbazine, hydroxyurea, cisplatin, cytosine arabinoside, cyclophosphamide and methylprednisolone.

We report the results of a prospective study of 11 patients with IOL who received conventional chemotherapy (CT), followed by salvage high-dose (HD) CT with autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT) in five cases. All 11 patients had abnormal funduscopic findings and six had CNS involvement at diagnosis. The diagnosis was based on vitrectomy in 10 cases and cerebral stereotaxic biopsy in one. Pathologic studies showed large-cell NHL in all cases. These large-cell NHL were of the B-cell type in 8 cases and of the T-cell type in two. First-line therapy consisted of a combination of cisplatin 25 mg/m2 as a 24-hour IV infusion on 4 consecutive days, VP-16 40 mg/m2 for 4 days, aracytine 2 g/m2 IV on day 5, and methylprednisolone 500 mg IV daily for 5 days (ESHAP) in 5 cases; alternating courses of ESHAP and HD methotrexate (MTX) in 4 cases; and HD MTX in 2 cases. Three patients underwent ocular and whole-brain radiation therapy. Five refractory patients subsequently received intensive CT with thiotepa 750 mg/m2, busulfan 10 mg/kg and cyclophosphamide 120 mg/kg, followed by ABMT. First-line treatment failed in 10 evaluable cases. One patient died of CNS progression at 12 months. All the patients who underwent intensive CT and ABMT entered CR; two relapsed at 6 months and three are alive in CR 15, 15 and 14 months after ABMT. Six patients are alive with persistent disease at 8, 13, 14, 15, 18 and 24 months.

The median age of the patients was 38 years (range 15 - 65). The baseline demographic features, in particular the major prognostic variables, were similar between the treatment groups. Patients treated with rituximab-CHOP-ESHAP received eight cycles of rituximab (375 mg m(-2) on day 1 of cycles 1 - 6 and days 21 and 28 of cycle 7) plus CHOP (day 3 of cycles 1, 3 and 5) and ESHAP (day 3 of cycles 2, 4 and 6 and day 1 of cycle 7) at 21-day intervals. Patients enrolled onto the CHOP-ESHAP-HDT arm (n = 23) were treated with three courses of CHOP and then switched to two or four cycles of ESHAP followed by HDT. Patients treated with CHOP alone (n = 25) were treated with the standard eight cycles of CHOP. The rate of complete remission was significantly improved with rituximab-CHOP-ESHAP compared with either CHOP-ESHAP-HDT or CHOP alone (67% compared with 44% and 36%, respectively; p = 0.043).

As some dyshematopoietic features had been observed in the bone marrow when the patient was first given a diagnosis of AA, it is conceivable that she already had hypoplastic myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) then. She was treated according to the JALSG-AML92 protocol and achieved complete remission (CR). In this case, the long-term administration of G-CSF may have played an important role in the transformation of MDS into AML. It may be difficult to strictly distinguish AA from hypoplastic MDS with slight dysplastic features, as in this case, because we have no established criteria. Recently the incidence of MDS/AML in AA patients undergoing G-CSF treatment has become a concern. We should be careful about ruling out hypoplastic MDS when diagnosing a condition as AA, especially when therapy includes G-CSF.

A small subset of patients has persistent HSRs during rapid desensitization that can be refractory to antihistamines and corticosteroids.

To the best of our knowledge, hematological malignancies presenting with central pontine myelinolysis have been rarely reported, especially in previously untreated patients, as in our case report. A 78-year-old Japanese woman presented to a neighborhood clinic with persistent high fever, edema, and general weakness.

She was admitted to our emergency department in a state of shock one month later. The results of her blood tests showed greatly elevated C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels. She had severe hypoalbuminemia and mild hyponatremia, and showed signs of disseminated intravascular coagulation.

Since cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) cases are rare, any hypothesis can only be based on case reports or small case series. We present the case of a male patient with folliculotropic mycosis fungoides (FMF) and synchronous autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) with extremely high levels of cancer antigen 19-9 (CA 19-9). The patient was under the supervision of a multidisciplinary team consisting of dermatologists, hepatologists, and hematologists. The patient died 15 months after the diagnoses of FMF and AIH were established and 3.5 years after the first skin changes. Based on our knowledge and search of medical databases, this is the first case of AIH in a patient with CTCL, i.e. with MF. A 53-year-old male patient was admitted to our Dermatology Clinic in September 2014 after being briefly treated with acitretin. During hospitalization, he was diagnosed with FMF, autoimmune hepatitis, and newly developed diabetes mellitus. At the time of hospital admission, about 70 percent of the surface of the skin was affected, infiltrated with numerous cysts on the face, neck, and upper thorax. The patient also presented with alopecia affecting most of the scalp, loss of eyebrows and eyelashes (Figure 1), and complained of intensive itching. The clinical presentation suggested the diagnosis of FMF, which was later confirmed based on histological (Figure 2) and immunohistochemical (Figure 3) findings. The histochemical staining method PAS-Alcian did not reveal mucin deposits. Immunohistochemical findings revealed tumor cells to show aberrant T-immunophenotypes - CD3+, CD2+, CD5-, CD7-, CD4+, CD8-, CD30-. Due to elevated serum conjugated bilirubin and extremely high levels of hepatocellular and cholestatic liver enzymes, the patient was transferred to the Gastroenterology Department. Diagnosis of AIH was established based on the liver biopsy (highly active autoimmune hepatitis) and the exclusion of viral etiology, drug-induced hepatotoxicity, and inherited metabolic disorders of the liver. CA 19-9 level was extremely high (4475.0; RR <37.0 \xb5g/L). In March 2015, CA 19-9 decreased to 365.3. In April 2015, erythroderma and small isolated tumors on the trunk and extremities developed. The patient was treated with RE-PUVA and radio-therapy. In June 2015, due to systemic symptoms, the patient was started on PUVA with IFN\u03b1. In November 2015, erythroderma persisted together with larger and ulcerated tumors. The patient was treated at the Hematological Department with two cycles of cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and methylprednisolone. From March 2015, the patient was continuously treated with ursodeoxycholic acid, prednisolone, azathioprine, analog insulin, and allopurinol. MSCT revealed lymphoma infiltrates in the liver, spleen, and peritoneum (gross tumors). The immunophenotypic analysis of the cells in ascites revealed atypical lymphocytes with convoluted nuclei - LCA+, CD3+, CD20-. The patient died in December 2015 due to sepsis with febrile neutropenia. Before death, he suffered from candidiasis and toxic liver damage due to fluconazole. FMF is an aggressive MF variant with infiltration of lymph nodes, visceral involvement at an earlier stage, and decreased life expectancy (4). Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is still an unclear progressive liver disease of unknown etiology which features hypergammaglobulinemia, detectable autoantibodies, and interface hepatitis (5). Being exposed to xenobiotic (acitretin) with consequent liver damage could lead to the formation of self-antigens to which the patient\'s immune system might have sensitized, and the autoimmune attack continued (6). Slightly elevated CA 19-9 levels in autoimmune hepatitis were reported by other authors (7-9). It should be noted that the liver involvement with atypical lymphocytes can be diffuse without any detectable nodules on a CT scan (4). Soluble liver antigen and liver-pancreas antibodies, together with CA 19-9, need to be implemented as routine diagnostic tools to rationalize the usage of tumor markers in day-to-day practice as well in diagnosis of AIH (10).","IncludeStatus":"Include","LisedInColA":"Yes","originalFormulation":"Yes","AloneOrComb":"Combination","cancerType":"Lymphoid","studyType":"Clinical case report","therapeuticAssociation":"No effect"},{"id":"553","Drug":"Methylprednisolone","PMID":"19687760","Title":"Mediastinal Kaposiform hemangioendothelioma and Kasabach-Merritt phenomenon in an infant: treatment with interferon","Authors":"Hartman KR, Moncur JT, Minniti CP, Creamer KM.","Citation":"J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2009 Sep;31(9):690-2. doi: 10.1097/MPH.0b013e3181a1c291.","CreatedDate":"8/19/09","Abstract":"A 2-week-old infant developed respiratory failure due to a mediastinal Kaposiform hemangioendothelioma that was complicated by thrombocytopenia and consumptive coagulopathy.

After 4-6 courses CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicine, vincristine, and prednisone) chemotherapy, an induction therapy with either the DexaBEAM (dexamethasone, carmustine, melphalan, etoposide, and cytarabine) or the ESHAP (etoposide, methylprednisolone, cytarabine, and cisplatin) protocol was administered. If a complete (CR) or a partial remission (PR) was achieved, myeloablative radiochemotherapy (hyperfractionated total body irradiation and high-dose cyclophosphamide) with APBSCT was performed. From June 2000 to November 2002, 30 patients (pts) were enrolled into the study. The two main PTCL subgroups included were PTCL not specified and angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (each n=12). In all, 21 of the 30 pts (70%) were transplanted. The main toxicities were myelosuppression and infections. The overall response rate after myeloablative therapy was 100% (20 CR, one PR). In total, 16 of 21 transplanted pts (76%) remained in CR at a median follow-up of 15 months (range, 6-32 months) from treatment start. Nine pts received no APBSCT mainly due to progressive disease. In conclusion, this first prospective PTCL-restricted study of frontline myeloablative radiochemotherapy with APBSCT shows feasibility and high efficacy.

The value of plasmaexchange (PE) in MG has been clearly established in preoperative preparation and treatment of myasthenic crisis. Whether PE may be used in the chronic long-term therapy of patients with thymomatous MG in addition to conventional immunosuppressive agents and cholinesterase inhibitors is yet to be answered. We present a 40-year old woman with an 11 year history of MG. Thymectomy was done during the first year of the disease and the histopathologic finding was thymoma. To sustain clinical remission after thymectomy she continued with immunosuppression with methylprednisolone and cyclosporin A (or azathioprine) in addition to cholinesterase inhibitors. Despite the almost continuous immunosuppression, the disease course continued with fluctuating myasthenic weakness which few times progressed to myasthenic crisis requiring mechanical ventilation. During myasthenic crisis we performed 6-8 plasmapheresis at 2-3 day intervals in addition to conventional immunosuppressive therapy. The disease rapidly worsened in January 2000 and we started with intermittent plasmapheresis (3-6 procedures at 2-3 day intervals, every 6-8 weeks) in order to sustain remission. With this therapeutic protocol, during 20 months follow-up we managed to prevent myasthenic crisis and to avoid ventilatory support. Plasmaexchange could be used as a successful and safe therapeutic tool in chronic long-term therapy in addition to conventional immunosuppressive agents to sustain remission in patients with MG. This is particularly important in the treatment of patients with thymomatous MG because they have an increased frequency of myasthenic crisis and often respond poorly an to immunosuppression with steroids or other immunosuppressants.","IncludeStatus":"Exclude","LisedInColA":"No Label","originalFormulation":"No Label","AloneOrComb":"No Label","cancerType":"No Label","studyType":"No Label","therapeuticAssociation":"No Label"},{"id":"563","Drug":"Methylprednisolone","PMID":"26182612","Title":"WATERSHED INFARCTION IN HYPEREOSINOPHILIC SYNDROME: A DIAGNOSTIC DILEMMA IN FIP1L1-PDGFR ALPHA-ASSOCIATED MYELOID NEOPLASM","Authors":"Marton I, P\u221a\u2265sfai \u221a\xe2, Annus JK, Borb\u221a\xa9nyi Z, Nemes A, Vecsei L, V\u221a\u2202r\u221a\u2202s E.","Citation":"Ideggyogy Sz. 2015 May 30;68(5-6):212-6. doi: 10.18071/isz.68.0212.","CreatedDate":"7/18/15","Abstract":"The FIP1L1-PDGFR alpha-positive, hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) is a new category of hematological entities.

A report on a long follow-up period (10 years) in a case of HES that presented with neuropsychiatric symptoms appears to be unique. Besides the complexity of the diagnostic process, the successful treatment is discussed. The HES was diagnosed in a male patient at the age of 33 years, with involvement of the central nervous system and the myocardium. After the onset of the clinical signs, the MRI indicated bilateral cerebral and cerebellar cortico-subcortical lesions involving the watershed areas, mainly in the parieto-occipital regions. High-dose intravenous steroid (methylprednisolone 500 mg/day) alleviated the neurological symptoms within a few weeks, and the administration of imatinib (200 mg/day) resulted in an impressive regression of the hypereosinophilia and splenomegaly within 6 weeks. During the follow-up, the patient has continued to receive imatinib. The molecular remission has persisted, no new complaints have developed and the condition of the patient has remained stable. The timely recognition of the HES and identification of the disease subtype which led to the administration of imatinib may be the key to successful treatment. The long stable follow-up period gives rise to a new dilemma in the treatment of the HES in these special cases: for how long should a patient receive a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, and may the treatment be suspended?","IncludeStatus":"Exclude","LisedInColA":"No Label","originalFormulation":"No Label","AloneOrComb":"No Label","cancerType":"No Label","studyType":"No Label","therapeuticAssociation":"No Label"},{"id":"564","Drug":"Methylprednisolone","PMID":"14689873","Title":"[Successful recovery of an acute myelogenous leukemia patient from a coma possibly due to leukoencephalopathy]","Authors":"Doki N, Saito Y, Hatsumi N, Irisawa H, Sakura T, Miyawaki S.","Citation":"Rinsho Ketsueki. 2003 Nov;44(11):1090-4.","CreatedDate":"12/24/03","Abstract":"A-36-year-old male diagnosed with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML, M2) failed to achieve a complete remission after having undergone two courses of induction chemotherapy (idarubicin hydrochloride + cytarabine, high-dose cytarabine), and moreover, his cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) then revealed abnormal blasts.

The patient received the transplant at the age of 3 years and was treated with tacrolimus and methylprednisolone for transplant rejection. Eleven years posttransplantation, he visited the hospital with general malaise and anemia. Blood tests revealed an elevated white blood cell count of 60,100/\u03bcL, and the patient was diagnosed with AML. Chromosome analysis revealed a t(6; 9) (p23 q34) translocation; moreover, genetic testing revealed a FLT3-ITD-positive mutation.

Other patients were reported in relatively early stages after liver transplantation, but our case was more than 10 years posttransplantation. The association with the onset of congenital bile duct atresia and leukemia is still not clear, but we consider the possibility that long-term immunosuppressive drugs contribute to developing leukemia.

At the end of follow-up, 16 patients were in CR, 31 in PR, eight had a persistent nephrotic syndrome, one had mild proteinuria, four had progressed to ESRD and five had died. Overall renal survival was 86% after 5 years and 74% after 7 years, compared with 32% after 5 and 7 years in a historical control group. Treatment-related complications occurred in two-thirds of patients, mainly consisting of bone marrow depression and infections. One patient has developed bladder cancer, another patient prostate cancer. Renal survival is good if patients with iMN and renal insufficiency are treated with oral cyclophosphamide. However, side effects occur frequently and relapse rate is high during longer follow-up.","IncludeStatus":"Exclude","LisedInColA":"No Label","originalFormulation":"No Label","AloneOrComb":"No Label","cancerType":"No Label","studyType":"No Label","therapeuticAssociation":"No Label"},{"id":"588","Drug":"Methylprednisolone","PMID":"10416011","Title":"ESHAP is an active regimen for relapsing Hodgkin\'s disease","Authors":"Aparicio J, Segura A, Garcer\u221a\xb0 S, Oltra A, Santaballa A, Yuste A, Pastor M.","Citation":"Ann Oncol. 1999 May;10(5):593-5. doi: 10.1023/a:1026454831340.","CreatedDate":"7/23/99","Abstract":"Refractory or relapsing Hodgkin\'s disease is associated with a poor prognosis.

A prospective clinical trial was carried out to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of ESHAP (etoposide, methylprednisolone, high-dose cytarabine, and cisplatin). Twenty-two patients with refractory (5) or relapsing Hodgkin\'s disease (17) were entered and scheduled to receive three courses of ESHAP. Patients suitable for AHT were then given high-dose chemotherapy with CBV (cyclophosphamide, carmustine, and etoposide) plus AHT, whereas responding, non-AHT-suitable patients completed six ESHAP courses. Nine patients achieved complete responses and seven partial responses (overall response rate 73%) with ESHAP. Grade 3-4 myelotoxicity was seen in 13 patients (59%). Nine patients received CBV plus AHT. At a median follow-up time of 50 months (range 6-96), seven patients (32%) are alive and disease-free. Three patients died of toxic effects of ESHAP (1) or CBV (2). Actuarial overall survival and disease-free survival were 35% and 27% at three years. ESHAP is an active regimen for relapsing Hodgkin\'s disease, with myelosuppression as its dose-limiting toxicity.

Herein we report a 26-year-old previously healthy male who presented with 4 years of progressive horizontal diplopia, right Parinaud syndrome, and appendicular ataxia. Neuroimaging revealed a right dorsal midbrain enhancing lesion which completely resolved with intravenous methylprednisolone prompting a diagnosis of neuroinflammatory syndrome. Subsequent clinical and radiographic evaluations, however, revealed steadily progressive left dorsal midbrain syndrome with an expansile enhancing lesion which culminated 4 years from symptom onset with a right upper extremity low-frequency rest, postural and action tremor, ataxic dysarthria, and mild right dystonia with dysdiadochokinesia. Uncomplicated brainstem biopsy confirmed intracranial germinoma and the patient underwent definitive radiation therapy with dramatic radiographic response and partial clinical improvement. This case, which to our knowledge is only the second report of intracranial germinoma presenting as Holmes\' tremor, highlights the critical importance of definitive tissue diagnosis in the evaluation of lesional brainstem pathology presenting as Holmes\' tremor. Steroid responsiveness can be seen in non-inflammatory pathology including intracranial germinoma. Prompt evaluation and appropriate treatment are important as Holmes\' tremor responds poorly to symptomatic therapies and response to radiation therapy is favorable for germinomas.","IncludeStatus":"Include","LisedInColA":"Yes","originalFormulation":"Yes","AloneOrComb":"Combination","cancerType":"CNS/Brain","studyType":"Clinical case report","therapeuticAssociation":"Inconclusive"},{"id":"593","Drug":"Methylprednisolone","PMID":"3766088","Title":"[Immune thrombocytopenia in Hodgkin\'s disease]","Authors":"Burghuber OC, Smolen J, K\u221a\xbahb\u221a\u2202ck J.","Citation":"Acta Med Austriaca. 1986;13(2):55-9.","CreatedDate":"1/1/86","Abstract":"Thrombocytopenic purpura of the idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) type is an unusual and poorly documented complication of Hodgkin\'s disease.

Today, steroids have become an important therapeutic tool in many diseases, but pharmacological mechanisms responsible for their side effects are still little known. The neuropsychiatric side effects concern 15% of patients while severe reactions occur in 5% of cases, mostly as acute psychotic episodes such as delusion. Serious forensic risks in this context are poorly documented and underestimated. We report the case of a 77 year-old man, treated by methylprednisolone for chronic lymphoid leukemia. After two months of treatment, although stabilized for the neoplastic disease, he stabbed his wife to death with a knife. In the emergency unit, an acute delirious state, a disorganization syndrome, and confusion items such as amnesia, disorientation and symptomatology fluctuation were observed. Mr. M also presented with hyponatremia and infectious pneumonia. Steroids were stopped and his condition rapidly declined, he died one month later during the hospitalization. This clinical case underlines the importance of the early detection of steroid psychosis and its management. Treatment should not be stopped brutally and a dose reducing strategy should be applied in combination with a mood stabilizer or antipsychotic treatment. Disease management strategies are insufficiently documented to be recommended. The extremely acute onset of the symptoms, a partial insight into delusions, a history of iatrogenic neuropsychiatry, the existence of somatic precipitating disorders and confusion factors should always alert the practitioner. The patient, and eventually his family circle, must be aware of the risks of adverse psychiatric effects of steroids for both ethical and forensic reasons, and must report them as early as possible to the clinician if they occur.","IncludeStatus":"Include","LisedInColA":"Yes","originalFormulation":"Yes","AloneOrComb":"Alone","cancerType":"Lymphoid","studyType":"Clinical case report","therapeuticAssociation":"Inconclusive"},{"id":"599","Drug":"Methylprednisolone","PMID":"16520806","Title":"Sustained remission from angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma induced by alemtuzumab","Authors":"Halene S, Zieske A, Berliner N.","Citation":"Nat Clin Pract Oncol. 2006 Mar;3(3):165-8; quiz 169. doi: 10.1038/ncponc0430.","CreatedDate":"3/8/06","Abstract":"A 73-year-old woman presented with acute lower back pain, fever, chills and arthralgias.

Therefore, we examined the in vitro effects, brought about by therapeutically attainable concentrations of various corticosteroids, on the proliferative response, production of gamma interferon (IFN-gamma), and induction of LAK activity from blood MNC of normal donors. Incubation in media containing rIL-2 (1000 U/ml) with either dexamethasone, hydrocortisone, methylprednisolone, or prednisolone profoundly affected all of these parameters. First, while 0.01 micrograms/ml of either dexamethasone or hydrocortisone caused a slight enhancement of the mitogenic response of lymphocytes to phytohemagglutinin, a dose-dependent decline occurred as concentrations increased to 10 micrograms/ml. The addition of prednisolone and methylprednisolone elicited a dose-dependent inhibition of lymphocyte proliferation over the entire concentration range tested. At 0.1 microgram/ml or higher, dexamethasone, hydrocortisone, methylprednisolone and prednisolone significantly (P less than 0.02) inhibited the production of IFN-gamma: respectively 18.9%, 4.4%, 2.2%, and 12.3% of the IFN-gamma produced by MNC in the absence of steroids. All four corticosteroids inhibited the induction of LAK activity. Compared to MNC that had been incubated with 1000 U/ml rIL-2 alone, MNC cultured with rIL-2 and 10 micrograms/ml either dexamethasone or prednisolone demonstrated significantly lower cytotoxicity (P less than 0.05) for the natural-killer-cell-resistant cell line, Daudi.

Bortezomib is a proteasome inhibitor which target mainly is NF-kappaB. This observation is to study the clinical treatment effect of bortezomib in one relapsed multiple myeloma (MM) patient and one primary refractory MM patient. The first patient diagnosed as IgA IIIA stage, whose state of disease became worse after 8 months of autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation. And the disease became further aggressive with 4 courses of chemical therapy regimen including methylprednisolone, Arsenic trioxide, dexamethasone, cyclophosphamide, mitoxantrone, VM-26. Myeloma cells in bone marrow and abnormal monoclonal immunoglobulin in blood plasma both increased. Bone destruction became severe, and there was a plasmacytoma about 5 x 6 cm on the patient\'s right upper chest wall. Therefore, the patient received therapy of bortezomib combined with doxrubicin, dexamethasone and thalidomide (VADT). After one course of therapy with this VADT regimen, IgA in blood plasma decreased from 54 g/L to 6.6 g/L, and abnormal plasma cells in bone marrow decreased from 40% to 0.6%, and plasmacytoma on the patient\'s right upper chest wall almost absorbed. But there was no obvious clinical effect after the second course of therapy of VADT, and the disease status became progressive again. The second patient was MM patient with a light chain kappa type, III B stage. There was no any effect after two courses of VAD therapy and one course of MOFP therapy. The patient acquired near complete remission after one course of treatment with VADT. Quantity of kappa protein in urine reduced from 24 - 30 g/24 hours to 1.12 g/24 hours. Blood creatinine reduced from 475.3 micromol/L to 124.2 micromol/L. Beta2-MG reduced from 161g/L to 64 g/L. And this patient got complete remission after three consecutive VADT therapy. The mainly side effects of the bortezomib regimen in the first patient include markedly lassitude, diarrhea, numbness of the end of extremities, marked increase of LDH. All the side effects could be tolerated and became disappeared after contraposing treatment and stopping the bortezomib regimen therapy. The second patient complicated with severe subacute left hemiplegia after the bortezomib dose had been increased to 1.45 mg/m2 at the third time of the first VADT course and the complication became worst at the following day. The upper limb muscle strength was only 1 grade and the lower limb muscle strength was 2 grade. Then the condition improved with the support therapy and gradually recovered after two weeks. Therefore, bortezomib is an effective target drug for therapy in refractory multiple myeloma, and more attentions to the side effects should be paid in order to deal with those side effects in time.","IncludeStatus":"Include","LisedInColA":"No","originalFormulation":"No","AloneOrComb":"Alone","cancerType":"Myeloid","studyType":"Clinical case report","therapeuticAssociation":"Inconclusive"},{"id":"611","Drug":"Methylprednisolone","PMID":"18444949","Title":"Successful autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation with a double-conditioning regimen for recurrent hepatoblastoma after liver transplantation","Authors":"Niwa A, Umeda K, Awaya T, Yui Y, Matsubara H, Hiramatsu H, Watanabe K, Adachi S, Itoh T, Uemoto S, Nakahata T.","Citation":"Pediatr Transplant. 2009 Mar;13(2):259-62. doi: 10.1111/j.1399-3046.2008.00948.x.

High-dose chemotherapy with autologous marrow or stem cell rescue (ABMT) is now a widely used salvage strategy in these patients. In this study, our objective was to determine the response rate to ASHAP (Adriamycin = doxorubicin, Solumedrol = methylprednisolone, High-dose Ara-C = cytosine arabinoside, and Platinum = cisplatinum), in a group of patients with Hodgkin\'s disease with such poor risk characteristics. The treatment was intended as a brief tumor reducing program before ABMT. Fifty-six patients with diagnosed relapsed or primary refractory Hodgkin\'s disease underwent this treatment. The program consisted of the administration of two cycles of ASHAP chemotherapy (doxorubicin 10 mg/m2/d intravenous (IV) continuous infusion (CI) over 24 hours, days 1 to 4; methylprednisolone 500 mg/d IV over 15 minutes daily for 5 days; cisplatinum 25 mg/m2/d IV CI over 24 hours, days 1 to 4; cytosine arabinoside 1.5 g/m2/d IV over 2 hours on day 5). After two courses of ASHAP the patients were evaluated for response, including a gallium scan test. Patients with progressive disease were taken off the study. Those with responding or stable disease received a third course of ASHAP, followed by consolidative treatment with ABMT. There were 19 complete responses (34% CR), 20 partial responses (36% PR), and 17 treatment failures, including 8 with minor responses and 9 with disease progression. Thus, in total there were 39 responses out of 56 patients (CR + PR = 70%). Myelosuppression was the main toxicity. There were no deaths due to toxicity. At this time, 23 patients are alive. There were 31 deaths due to disease progression and 2 due to other causes. The initial response to ASHAP before subsequent ABMT consolidation treatment correlated with survival. All 17 patients in whom ASHAP failed to achieve a response have died. The presence of B symptoms at relapse, and a duration of response to the last regimen of </=6 months, predicted a poor response to ASHAP.

T-cell responses against HHV-8 lytic and latent antigens were analyzed by ex vivo enzyme-linked immunospot (Elispot) and HHV-8 viral load was assessed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction, in sequential peripheral blood samples from a 55-year-old woman who developed skin/mucosal and visceral KS, while receiving treatment with cyclosporine, methotrexate, and methylprednisolone for undifferentiated arthritis. KS may result from HHV-8 infection in patients undergoing immunosuppressive treatment for rheumatic diseases and this is the first case of IKS occurring in undifferentiated arthritis. A role for immune surveillance in the pathogenesis of IKS is supported by the observation of disease regression following discontinuation of immunosuppressive therapy. In a 4-year follow-up, we showed that variations of the virus-specific immune responses but not of the viral load correlated well with the disease course, characterized by 2 remission and subsequent relapse phases, following changes of immunosuppressive therapy. We have provided evidence of a clear-cut correlation between changes in immunologic markers of HHV-8 infection and the disease course of this viral associated tumor, concomitant with variations of immunosuppressive treatment. Thus, ex vivo enzyme-linked immunospot for HHV-8-specific T-cell responses represents a new tool for the clinical management of rheumatic patients with IKS.","IncludeStatus":"Exclude","LisedInColA":"No Label","originalFormulation":"No Label","AloneOrComb":"No Label","cancerType":"No Label","studyType":"No Label","therapeuticAssociation":"No Label"},{"id":"627","Drug":"Methylprednisolone","PMID":"21679253","Title":"Lenalidomide can be highly effective in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia despite T-cell depletion and deletion of chromosome 17p","Authors":"Arumainathan A, Kalakonda N, Pettitt AR.","Citation":"Eur J Haematol. 2011 Oct;87(4):372-5. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2011.01667.x.

Anatomic location: proximal femur (4), proximal humerus (2), and proximal tibia (2). Both age and location were atypical when compared to the classic metaphyseal location. Radiographically, all lesions presented a characteristic involvement of the epiphysis and metaphysis in various proportions. The epiphyseal plates were judged closed versus open in 50%, respectively.

We conclude the age, location, and radiographic appearance is atypical and diagnosis is difficult, but the biological behavior is less aggressive and the prognosis more favorable than the typical, metaphyseal UBC. Curettage with or without bone graft has a high success rate. We recommend aspiration and intralesional methylprednisolone as the initial management.

Protocol 91-01, the successor 91-01P, was also similar, with the exception of the deletion of a single dose of L-asparaginase. Sixteen of the 38 children (42%) treated on the DFCI 91-01P had documented gram positive or gram negative sepsis (17 episodes) during remission induction, including 4 toxic deaths (11%).

Substitution of dexamethasone for prednisone or methylprednisolone in an otherwise intensive conventional induction regimen for previously untreated children with ALL resulted in an alarmingly high incidence of septic episodes and toxic deaths.

HDMP was administered orally at a single dose of 20-30 mg/kg/day combined with low-dose cytosine arabinoside (LD Ara-C) (10 mg/m2, 12-hourly s.c.) for 2 weeks. The treatment continued with mitoxantrone (10 mg/m2, i.v.) and Ara-C (5 mg/kg, i.v.) once a week for four doses followed by maintenance chemotherapy. All patients achieved hematologic remission 2-4 weeks after initiation of treatment. Extramedullary infiltration disappeared in all cases within 2 weeks to 3 months after initiation of therapy. With the exception of two patients who relapsed 6 and 24 months after remission, treatment could be stopped in others who remained in remission for 36 months without evidence of EMI; 6 months later one of them developed myelodysplastic relapse (RAEB). No side effects related to HDMP treatment were noted, but hyperleukocytosis developed in two patients who initially had high WBC counts. We suggest that the addition of HDMP with or without LD Ara-C to cytotoxic chemotherapy offers a promising alternative in cases not considered suitable for bone marrow transplantation.","IncludeStatus":"Include","LisedInColA":"Yes","originalFormulation":"Yes","AloneOrComb":"Alone","cancerType":"Myeloid","studyType":"Clinical case report","therapeuticAssociation":"Effective"},{"id":"653","Drug":"Methylprednisolone","PMID":"7495619","Title":"[A 49-year-old man with progressive dysarthria, dysphagia, and left hemiparesis]","Authors":"Nishimiya J, Yamaji Y, Nitta T, Mori H, Yamamura A, Shirai T, Kondo T, Sato K, Mizuno Y.","Citation":"No To Shinkei. 1995 Nov;47(11):1109-18.","CreatedDate":"11/1/95","Abstract":"We report a 49-year-old man who presented progressive dysarthria, dysphagia, and left hemiparesis.

In the beginning of July, he noted difficulty in swallowing solid foods. He was admitted to the neurosurgery service of our hospital on July 15th of 1993 and a neurologic consultation was asked on July 17th. Neurologic examination at that time revealed an alert but somewhat childish man who appeared to have some difficulty in paying attention to questions. He was disoriented to time and showed difficulty in recent memory and calculation. Higher cerebral functions were intact. The optic fundi were normal; pupils were isocoric and reacted to light promptly; ocular movements were intact, however, he showed difficulty in convergence. Facial sensation and facial muscles were intact. He had no deafness. He showed slurred speech and difficulty in swallowing solid foods. The remaining cranial nerves were intact. Motor-wise, he was able to walk normally and no weakness or atrophy was noted. Mild ataxia was noted in the finger-to-nose and the heel-to-knee test on the left. Muscle stretch reflexes were normal and symmetric, however, the plantar response was extensor bilaterally. Sensation was intact and no meningeal signs were noted. General routine laboratory findings were unremarkable. CSF was under a normal pressure containing 1 cell/microliter, 68 mg/dl of protein, and 54 mg/dl of glucose. Cranial CT scan showed low density areas involving the pons, midbrain, left thalamus, and the left parietal cortex. In MRI, these areas presented low signal intensity in T1-weighted images and high signal intensity in T2-weighted in images. The brain stem appeared swollen. Gadolinium enhancement was negative. He was given a course of steroid pulse with 1 g/day of DIV methylprednisolone for three days followed by oral steroid. He showed only temporary improvement in swallowing. In the subsequent course, he showed progressive deterioration in dysarthria and dysphagia. A biopsy was performed on the left parietal lobe lesion. After biopsy, he was treated with steroid and glycerol without improvement. A course of chemotherapy with procarbazine, MCNU, and vincristine was given; he did not respond to chemotherapy. His left hemiparesis deteriorated. He developed aspiration pneumonia from dysphagia and expired on October 22, 1993.

Only 28 observations have been reported so far, all with a very poor prognosis: a median survival of 12.5 weeks. The authors report the case of a 78-year-old male with primary non-Hodgkin\'s lymphoma of the right adrenal gland. Disease onset was characterized by severe autoimmune hemolytic anemia, and diagnosis was made by echo-guided biopsy. The patient was admitted to our Department with severe autoimmune hemolytic anemia; the hemoglobin value was 6.5 g/dL and both indirect and direct Coombs\' tests were positive. Steroid treatment with methylprednisolone 2 mg/kg/day did not improve the hemolytic process. Abdominal ultrasound examination disclosed a right hypoechogenic suprarenal mass of 10 x 9 cm; imaging techniques such as computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging were not useful in the etiologic diagnosis of the right suprarenal mass; fine needle aspiration and tissue-core biopsy revealed low-grade non-Hodgkin\'s lymphoma. Staging procedures, including clinical examination, total body computed tomography scan, bone-marrow biopsy, gallium scan, abdominal magnetic resonance imaging, did not disclose other sites of involvement and strongly supported a diagnosis of primary non-Hodgkin\'s lymphoma of the right adrenal gland. Hormone assays were within normal limits. The patient was treated with chemotherapy, cyclophosphamide-vincristine-prednisone regimen, with good regression of the adrenal mass after 6 courses, and normalization of hemoglobin level and negativity of Coombs\' tests. The importance of this case lies in the very rare occurrence of this disease, its association with autoimmune hemolytic anemia, the diagnosis made by ultrasound-guided biopsy, and good response to treatment with respect to cases reported in the literature.

Microsurgery was performed immediately on the day of admission because cerebral angiography revealed bilateral distal anterior cerebral artery aneurysms. Consciousness gradually deteriorated due to cerebral vasospasm from the 3rd day following surgery. To protect the brain, corticosteroid (methylprednisolone 1500 mg, dexamethasone 252 mg) was administered for 26 days after surgery. In spite of treatment, in March 1987 neurological examination revealed akinetic mutism, but CT scan did not reveal any evidence of tumor. CT scan performed on May 2, 1987, revealed a mass lesion in the left frontotemporal lobes and left basal ganglia. Histological diagnosis of malignant lymphoma (diffuse, large-cell type) was obtained by stereotactic biopsy. Radiotherapy (41 Gy of 60Co) was carried out. The CT scan performed on August 26, 1987 revealed that the abnormal enhanced lesion had disappeared. However, neurological findings had not remarkably improved.

Whole body CT scan and 67Gd scintigram did not reveal any other tumors except in the brain. Ruptured cerebral aneurysm followed by primary intracranial malignant lymphoma is very rarely reported. In such cases, which have unusual clinical courses and CT findings, we recommend stereotactic biopsy to treat this kind of radiosensitive tumor.

The cerebro-spinal fluid showed pleocytosis (56/mm3, neutorophils and lymphocytes were 26 and 28, respectively). Thus, she was diagnosed as aseptic meningitis. A few days later, she had weakness and dysesthesia of the right face and the left extremities. Pulse therapy with intravenous methylprednisolone was started. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain showed a hemorrhagic infarction in the right parietal lobe. In hemostatic markers, thrombin-antithrombin III complex(TAT; 106 ng/dl), D-dimer 1234 ng/dl, prothrombin fragment 1 + 2(F1 + 2; 2.36 nmol/L), beta-thromboglobulin (beta TG; 4,300 ng/dl) and platelet factor 4 (PF-4; 1,770 ng/dl) were extremely elevated. On duplex ultrasonography, a low echo lucent plaque was observed at the right internal carotid artery and the mean blood flow velocity in the right carotid artery was decreased. She was placed on oral prednisolone and warfarin for suspected stroke due to hypercoagulability associated with vasculitis. Afterwards, she discharged from our hospital. Two months later, she was readmitted to our hospital because of irregular menses and vaginal bleeding. Endometrial uterus biopsy was conducted, which revealed a grade I endometrioid adenocarcinoma. She was under total uterectomy without tumor recurrence. After the radical operation, white-cell count, RF, CRP, TAT, D-dimer, F1 + 2, and beta TG were normalized, and the mean flow velocity of the right common carotid artery was increased. Thereafter, she did not experience stroke recurrence. Therefore, we speculated that she had stroke due to hypercoagulability in association with malignancy, that is Trousseau\'s syndrome. We also assumed that aseptic meningitis, brainstem encephalitis associated with vasculitis in this patient are other clinical variants of paraneoplastic syndrome through immunological mechanisms associated with malignancy.

He was admitted to the ophthalmology service of our hospital on April 9, 1990, and neurological consultation was asked on April 11. Neurologic examination revealed alert and oriented man without dementia. Higher cerebral functions were intact. He had bilateral large visual field defects with loss of vision; he was only able to count the digit number with his right eye and to recognize hand movement with his left eye. Otherwise neurologic examination was unremarkable. General physical examination was also unremarkable; he had no hypertension. Cranial CT scan was normal on April 11; lumber spinal fluid contained 1 cell/microliter, 63 mg/dl of sugar, and 97 mg/dl of protein; myelin basic protein was detected, however, oligoclonal bands were absent. He was treated with methylprednisolone pulse therapy and oral steroid, however, no improvement was noted in his vision. He started to show gaze paresis to left, ideomotor apraxia, agnosia of the body, and dementia. Cranial CT scan on June 11 revealed a low density area in the deep left parietal white matter facing the trigonal area of the lateral ventricle. He was discharged on July 2, 1990. Hasegawa dementia scale was 2/32.5 upon discharge. In the subsequent course, he showed improvement in his mental capacity and Hasegawa dementia scale was 22.5/32.5 in 1991, however, no improvement was noted in his vision. In 1994, he started to show mental decline in that he became disoriented, and showed delusional ideation of self persecution and depersonalization with occasional confusional state. He also showed unsteady gait. Cranial MRI on February 13, 1996 revealed a T2-high signal intensity lesion on each side of the parietal deep white matter more on the left and another T2-high signal intensity lesion in the left pons as well as in the right thalamus. He complained of right hypochondrial pain and was admitted to another hospital on April 22, 1996. He was markedly confused and demented. He continued to show bilateral loss of vision, but no motor palsy was noted. Cranial CT scan on April 23, 1996 revealed diffuse cortical atrophy and ventricular dilatation in addition to the low density areas in both parietal deep white matter. He developed jaundice in the middle of May. Abdominal CT scan revealed multiple low-to iso-density areas in the liver and marked iso-to high-density swelling of the right kidney.

Herein, we report a large granular lymphocyte (LGL) leukemia patient with pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) after renal transplantation. A 36-year-old female was presented to our department with anemia in February 1996. She had undergone hemodialysis because of pregnancy in December 1981. She received a renal transplantation from her mother in April 1986. After the transplantation, she received cyclosporin A (CyA) at 2 mg/kg/day, mizoribine at 1 mg/kg/day, and methylprednisolone at 0.1 mg/kg/day for 8 years. In July 1995, her hemoglobin level dropped to 9.3 g/dl, and anemia developed gradually. In January 1996, her hemoglobin was 5.8 g/dl, and she was given a red blood cell transfusion. Laboratory findings were as follows: RBC 1.46 x 10(12)/L; hemoglobin 5.8 g/dl; hematocrit 17.8%; leucocytes 5.2 x 10(9)/L with 62.4% neutrophils, 34.1% lymphocytes, 2.6% monocytes; platelets 50.8 x 10(10)/L; reticulocytes 0.4%. Bone marrow aspirate smears and biopsy sections revealed normal myeloid and megakaryocyte differentiation with few erythroid precursors. The lymphocytes were of medium size with granules in the cytoplasm. More than 90% of lymphocytes were of the LGL type. Surface markers of peripheral blood mononuclear cells demonstrated increases in the CD2+, CD3+, CD4-, and CD8+ populations. A monoclonal rearrangement of T-cell receptor (TCR)-beta chain gene was found by Southern blot analysis of the mononuclear cells in peripheral blood. A diagnosis of LGL leukemia with PRCA was made. During the next 4 months, she received six red blood cell transfusions, a total of 12 U. In March 1996, the patient was treated with cyclophosphamide (1 mg/kg/day). After 1 month of treatment, serum GPT levels increased to 60 IU/l. The dose of cyclophosphamide was reduced to 0.5 mg/kg/day.

Tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha antagonism with infliximab is described favourably in retrospective series and open-label trials. However, evidence from the WGET (Wegener\'s Granulomatosis Etanercept Trial) does not support the clinical use of etanercept, and a significantly higher malignancy rate following TNFalpha inhibition questions the role of this approach. Uncontrolled evidence alone supports remission induction with rituximab-mediated B-lymphocyte depletion and may be less effective in predominantly granulomatous AAV. Remission following T-lymphocyte depletion can be achieved with alemtuzumab and antithymocyte globulin, but it is not yet clear what the clinical role will be for these agents in AAV. In addition, these agents are associated with prolonged lymphopenia and pulmonary complications, respectively. Stem cell transplantation to support immune reconstitution following the use of such agents has been trialled in AAV, but studies included very few patients. Purine and pyrimidine antimetabolites mycophenolate mofetil and leflunomide are likely to play an important role in the treatment of AAV, but results supporting remission maintenance and induction in the former are limited to uncontrolled trials, such that their use remains experimental at this time. Similarly, 15-deoxyspergualin may provide an alternative to cyclophosphamide but awaits randomized controlled trial evidence. The MEPEX (MEthylprednisolone versus Plasma EXchange) trial supports plasma exchange in renal disease but this may be limited by pulmonary complications. Randomized controlled evidence also exists for intravenous immunoglobulin, although improvement may not be sustained. Antimicrobial therapy may be of use in Wegener\'s granulomatosis patients with predominantly upper respiratory tract involvement. Safety concerns, notably of infection and malignancy, were common and need to be explored in subsequent trials. In addition, concomitant immunosuppressants and non-standardized definitions were major limitations, and future studies of these and newer agents must follow agreed standards of study design and reporting to facilitate clearer interpretation of the circumstances (e.g. disease stage, severity or organ involvement) under which these agents perform optimally. Consequently, use is still limited to centres experienced in such agents and mostly in the context of clinical trials.","IncludeStatus":"Exclude","LisedInColA":"No Label","originalFormulation":"No Label","AloneOrComb":"No Label","cancerType":"No Label","studyType":"No Label","therapeuticAssociation":"No Label"},{"id":"678","Drug":"Methylprednisolone","PMID":"30879590","Title":"Isolated Pulmonary Cryptococcosis Confused with Lung Tumor 5 Years After Kidney Transplantation: A Case Report","Authors":"Banshodani M, Marubayashi S, Shintaku S, Moriishi M, Tsuchiya S, Ohdan H, Kawanishi H.","Citation":"Transplant Proc. 2019 Mar;51(2):561-564. doi: 10.1016/j.transproceed.2018.12.007.

Here, we report a case of isolated pulmonary cryptococcosis after kidney transplantation that was difficult to distinguish from a lung tumor. A 52-year-old man underwent a kidney transplant from his mother when he was 44 years old. Immunosuppression was maintained with tacrolimus, methylprednisolone, and mycophenolate mofetil. His post-transplant course was uneventful and serum creatinine levels were maintained. Five years post-transplantation, a non-contrast computed tomography (CT) examination revealed a nodule measuring 3 mm in diameter in the middle lobe of the right lung. The nodule gradually increased to 12 mm in 2 years. Positron emission tomography/CT examination showed a maximum standardized uptake value of 0.5 for the nodule. Biochemical examination revealed no elevation in total leucocyte count and C-reactive protein levels. However, tumor markers were elevated: serum carcinoembryonic antigen, 5.9 ng/mL; pro-gastrin-releasing peptide, 84.6 pg/mL. Furthermore, the serum cryptococcus antigen was negative. Therefore, thoracoscopic partial lung resection was performed. Pathologically, a number of spherical fungi from the necrotic substance of the tumor were confirmed positive by periodic acid-Schiff and Grocott-Gomori staining. The patient was therefore diagnosed with pulmonary cryptococcosis. Two years later, the patient is alive and has shown no evidence of recurrence. In lung nodules after kidney transplantation, even if serum cryptococcus antigen is not identified, it is necessary to keep in mind the possibility of pulmonary cryptococcosis.","IncludeStatus":"Exclude","LisedInColA":"No Label","originalFormulation":"No Label","AloneOrComb":"No Label","cancerType":"No Label","studyType":"No Label","therapeuticAssociation":"No Label"},{"id":"679","Drug":"Methylprednisolone","PMID":"27178679","Title":"Multifocal Epstein-Barr Virus-Negative Posttransplantation Lymphoproliferative Disorder Treated With Reduction of\xac\u2020Immunosuppression","Authors":"Miyazono A, Okamoto Y, Nagasako H, Hamasaki Y, Shishido S, Yoshioka T, Kawano Y.","Citation":"Am J Kidney Dis. 2016 Sep;68(3):469-72. doi: 10.1053/j.ajkd.2016.03.425.

A boy with a mutation in the WT1 gene developed bilateral Wilms tumor at 15 months and received a kidney transplant at the age of 4 years. At 13 years of age, the patient\'s condition was managed with methylprednisolone, tacrolimus, and mycophenolate mofetil. He developed Epstein-Barr virus-negative monomorphic PTLD with numerous nodular lesions in the liver, vertebral bodies, and gastric wall. To reduce immunosuppression, we discontinued mycophenolate mofetil treatment, decreased tacrolimus dosage to 1mg/d, and increased methylprednisolone dosage to 2mg/d. The PTLD lesions drastically diminished in size within several days and disappeared 144 days after reduction of immunosuppression, although the patient had several factors indicating a poor prognosis. As of 13 months after reduction of immunosuppression for PTLD, the transplanted kidney was still functional. We conclude that even when patients with PTLD have a poor prognosis, reduction of immunosuppression alone may result in complete remission when the early response is excellent.

Adverse hematological events associated with TAS-102 treatment were extensively profiled in the RECOURSE trial, but pulmonary toxicities associated with TAS-102 therapy are distinctly uncommon. In a recent early post-marketing phase vigilance on TAS-102 in Japan, seven cases of pulmonary disease were reported, but patient follow-up in this study was incomplete. Here, we present the first case of interstitial lung disease occurring in association with TAS-102 treatment. A 57-year-old Japanese man who had previously received two standard treatments was admitted in 2014, at which time we administered TAS-102 (110 mg/day) as a third-line chemotherapy. He was safely treated with TAS-102 for the first planned cycle; however, approximately 4 days after receiving the second cycle of TAS-102, he complained of high fever and subsequent dyspnea with severe hypoxemia and went to the emergency room. A chest X-ray revealed diffuse coarse reticular shadows with ground-glass opacity on both lungs. Furthermore, a chest computed tomography scan showed thickening of the bronchovascular bundles with extensive ground-glass opacification and pleural effusions in both lung fields. In addition, a peripheral blood lymphocyte stimulation test with TAS-102 showed higher values compared with control samples. Consequently, we suspected drug-induced interstitial pneumonia, and discontinued treatment. Our patient was given an initial administration of high-dose methylprednisolone (1000 mg/day) for 3 days and oxygen. Our patient was discharged with oral prednisolone (20 mg/day) and improved symptomatically and radiologically. These findings suggest that interstitial pneumonia is a rare complication of TAS-102 chemotherapy, but the possibility of interstitial pneumonia should always be considered when a patient presents with a respiratory disorder while undergoing TAS-102 systemic chemotherapy. Prompt discontinuation of TAS-102 and treatment with high-dosage corticosteroids is needed to avoid exacerbating respiratory symptoms.","IncludeStatus":"Include","LisedInColA":"No","originalFormulation":"Yes","AloneOrComb":"Alone","cancerType":"Don\'t know","studyType":"Clinical case report","therapeuticAssociation":"Effective"},{"id":"682","Drug":"Methylprednisolone","PMID":"23185172","Title":"Lymphomatosis cerebri Presenting as a Recurrent Leukoencephalopathy","Authors":"Courtois F, Gille M, Haven F, Hantson P.","Citation":"Case Rep Neurol. 2012 Sep;4(3):181-6. doi: 10.1159/000343947.

As low titers of cytomegalovirus-IgM antibodies were found in the serum, a presumed diagnosis of postviral acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) was made, and the patient received a 5-day course of 1 g methylprednisolone.

At two years, graft survival was 84% for the monotherapy and 90% for the triple therapy. This difference was not statistically significant. The number of rejection episodes was similar in the two groups, but the severity of rejection was significantly worse among the patients on monotherapy. More kidneys were lost because of rejection (6 versus 3), and a higher number of methylprednisolone pulses was used for treating rejection (5.2 +/- 2.3 versus 4.3 +/- 2.9; P = 0.0077). CsA nephrotoxicity episodes were more frequent among patients on monotherapy (23 versus 7; P less than 0.02). Infectious episodes were equally distributed between the two groups. Creatinine clearance was poorer in the monotherapy-treated patients at the third month (42 +/- 16 ml/min versus 48 +/- 15 ml/min; P = 0.02), but no differences were observed between the two groups since the sixth month after transplantation. Many patients on monotherapy required changes in maintenance therapy. In fact, one patient was switched to conventional immunosuppression because of Cremophor-induced anaphylaxis. Another patient who developed Kaposi\'s sarcoma 4 months after surgery was switched to steroids alone. Excluding 5 patients who lost their grafts a few days after transplantation, only 30 of 74 patients (40%) could be kept without steroids. We conclude that both the therapeutic protocols can give good results in renal allotransplantation; however, monotherapy could create some problems in keeping the balance between drug toxicity and significant immunosuppression. On the contrary, triple therapy is easier to handle, especially in the early posttransplant period when the differential diagnosis between acute rejection and CsA-related nephrotoxicity can be difficult even for a skilled clinician.","IncludeStatus":"Exclude","LisedInColA":"No Label","originalFormulation":"No Label","AloneOrComb":"No Label","cancerType":"No Label","studyType":"No Label","therapeuticAssociation":"No Label"},{"id":"684","Drug":"Methylprednisolone","PMID":"25031933","Title":"Pregnancy in a patient with cancer and heart failure: challenges and complexities","Authors":"Fadol AP, Lech T, Bickford C, Yusuf SW.","Citation":"J Adv Pract Oncol. 2012 Mar;3(2):85-93. doi: 10.6004/jadpro.2012.3.2.3.","CreatedDate":"7/18/14","Abstract":"A 24-year-old African American female (L.R.) with a history of smoking and gestational diabetes was diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma.

Two years later, L.R. had disease relapse in the mediastinum and received two cycles of ESHAP (etoposide, methylprednisolone, high-dose cytarabine, cisplatin) followed by etoposide and ifosfamide. She then received BEAM (carmustine, etoposide, cytarabine, and melphalan) as a conditioning regimen and underwent autologous bone marrow transplant. Her post-transplant course was complicated by cytomegalovirus antigenemia, aspergillus pneumonia, and congestive heart failure with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 20%-25%. She was treated with an ACE inhibitor (lisinopril) and a beta-blocker (carvedilol) with improvement of her LVEF to 30%-35%. A follow-up chest x-ray showed an increase in the size of the anterior mediastinal adenopathy suspicious for relapse of lymphoma, and at the same time she was also found to be 5 weeks pregnant. Given her cardiomyopathy, significant obesity, poorly controlled diabetes, and cancer recurrence, L.R. was advised by her gynecologist that the pregnancy was very high risk and might not be viable. The oncologists advised her to terminate the pregnancy within the first trimester, as she needed salvage radiotherapy treatment to the mediastinum and chemotherapy treatments that might endanger the fetus. However, the patient decided to continue with the pregnancy. A multidisciplinary team-which included a cardiologist, oncologist, high-risk obstetrician, pharmacist, and nurse practitioner-was then involved to provide care during the pregnancy. A social worker was also solicited to help with home and financial issues because L.R. was a single mother with a 2-year-old son. L.R. was treated with carvedilol and furosemide, with monthly cardiology clinical follow-up during the first and second trimesters, then every 2 weeks starting with the 28th week, and weekly thereafter until delivery. Between visits, she notified the clinic for symptoms of heart failure exacerbation and was seen as necessary. The possible in utero effects of both medications were discussed with the patient. L.R. had a normal uncomplicated pregnancy and delivered a 6-pound, 10-ounce healthy boy at 39 weeks via vaginal delivery and was discharged home 2 days later.

This prospective study compared the safety and efficacy of steroid avoidance in tacrolimus (TAC)/mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and TAC/sirolimus (SRL) combinations in kidney transplantation. In all, 150 kidney recipients were analyzed: 75 each in TAC/MMF and TAC/SRL groups. The primary endpoint was acute rejection. Surveillance biopsies were completed to analyze subclinical acute rejection (SCAR) and chronic allograft nephropathy (CAN). Acute rejection and SCAR were treated by methylprednisolone. Two-year patient and graft survival, renal function, and adverse effects were monitored. Acute rejection was seen in 12% of TAC/MMF and 8% of TAC/SRL patients. Two-year actuarial patient survival was 95% and 97%, and graft survival 90% and 90% in TAC/MMF and TAC/SRL groups, respectively. Surveillance biopsy showed cumulative incidence of SCAR was 27 % in TAC/MMF and 16 % in TAC/SRL groups at 2 years (P = 0.04). Overall, 33% of recipients in TAC/MMF and 20% in TAC/SRL received methylprednisolone for acute rejection/SCAR. Moderate/severe CAN was 10% in TAC/SRL group and 22% in TAC/MMF group(P = 0.06). New-onset diabetes mellitus (NODM) was 4% each in both groups. All recipients remain free of maintenance steroid therapy. Steroid avoidance in tacrolimus-based immunosuppression with MMF or SRL provides equivalent 2-year patient and graft survival with a low incidence of acute rejection and NODM. SCAR and CAN are lower in TAC/SRL compared to TAC/MMF group. The impact of decreased SCAR and CAN in TAC/SRL group on longer-term graft survival and function is to be evaluated.","IncludeStatus":"Exclude","LisedInColA":"No Label","originalFormulation":"No Label","AloneOrComb":"No Label","cancerType":"No Label","studyType":"No Label","therapeuticAssociation":"No Label"},{"id":"686","Drug":"Methylprednisolone","PMID":"24637913","Title":"Transverse myelitis associated with an itchy rash and hyperckemia: neuromyelitis optica associated with dermatitis herpetiformis","Authors":"Iyer A, Rathnasabapathi D, Elsone L, Mutch K, Terlizzo M, Footitt D, Jacob A.","Citation":"JAMA Neurol. 2014 May;71(5):630-3. doi: 10.1001/jamaneurol.2013.6277.","CreatedDate":"3/19/14","Abstract":"Neuromyelitis optica is associated with severe neurodisability if not recognized and treated promptly.

FP/Salm has been shown to control symptoms of asthma and COPD better than a double dose of inhaled steroids. The patient in our report had a history of COPD, and suffered relapse of RP when given only steroids. It is possible that COPD history helps explain this patient\'s more difficult treatment course. Therefore, this combination may be more effective than inhaled steroids for patients with a history of COPD. This patient suffered adverse reactions triggered by methylprednisolone: weight gain, hyperglycaemia and sleep disturbance after more than two months of intravenous and oral prednisolone. These reactions disappeared when we switched the patients to FP/Salm maintenance therapy. The patient underwent upper right lobectomy in September 2011. Immunohistochemistry indicated low squamous cell differentiation, and he was diagnosed with stage IIB disease (T2N1M0) according to the Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) (7th edition).One month after repeat radiotherapy, the patient experienced fever (37.6\xb0C), cough, chest distress and shortness of breath. We performed serologic tests, laboratory tests for procalcitonin and C-reactive protein, as well as sputum and blood cultures to rule out bacterial infection. Chest CT showed consolidation with air bronchogram in the hilum of the right lung and ground-glass densities in the right lower lobe and left upper lobe. These radiographic signs are typical of RP. Since the patient required oxygen, he was diagnosed with grade III RP. After the patinet was diagnosed with grade III RP. The patient was immediately prescribed oxygen, anti-infectives for prophylaxis, treatments to facilitate expectoration and prevent asthma, and most importantly, intravenous methylprednisone at an initial dose of 60\u200a per day. And we cut the steroid dose in half every one week when the patient\'s symptoms improved obviously, and the patchy shadow on the chest radiograph sharply reduced. Then we give him FP (500\u200amg)/Salm (50\u200amg) twice daily for two months. Then the dose was halved for an additional two months. The patient showed no signs of tumor or RP relapse by the last follow-up in March 2018. This maintenance therapy of FP/Salm for patient with grade III RP may help avoid relapse when steroid therapy is tapered, particularly for patients with a history of COPD. It may also reduce risk of steroid-associated adverse effects. Based on the results observed with our patient, we intend to design a prospective trial to assess the efficacy of FP/Salm when used as preventive treatment for patients at high risk of RP, and when used as maintenance treatment for patients with grade III RP.","IncludeStatus":"Exclude","LisedInColA":"No Label","originalFormulation":"No Label","AloneOrComb":"No Label","cancerType":"No Label","studyType":"No Label","therapeuticAssociation":"No Label"},{"id":"689","Drug":"Methylprednisolone","PMID":"29950240","Title":"[Efficacy and Safety of MSC Infusion in Treatment of Children with Refractory LOHC: A Clinical Study]","Authors":"Qiu KY, Liao XY, Guo SY, Qi HN, Lan JJ, Fang JP, Huang K, Li Y, Xu HG, Zhou DH.","Citation":"Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2018 Jun;26(3):900-904. doi: 10.7534/j.issn.1009-2137.2018.03.045.","CreatedDate":"6/29/18","Abstract":"To study the curative effect and safety of menchymal stem cell infusion in treatment of children with refractory late-onset hemorrhagic cystitis(LOHC) after allogeneic HSCT.

The laryngeal margin and hypopharyngeal mucosa appeared highly inflammatory with fibrinous deposits. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed mucositis with a scar-like structure immediately below the upper esophageal sphincter with nonulcerative mucosa and an inflammatory aspect of the entire esophagus. No involvement of the stomach was observed. Oropharynx biopsies displayed marked lymphocytic T cell-infiltration with several foci of monocellular necrosis in the squamous epithelium. No morphologic evidence of adenocarcinoma and no signs of mycotic, bacterial or viral infection were noted. A blood sample revealed a discrete increase in the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) with no eosinophilia or leukocytosis. Liver and kidney function panel tests were normal. A thoracoabdominal CT scan reported no evidence of disease recurrence. Despite multiple boluses of methylprednisolone and high doses of prednisone continued for several months, the patient experienced very rapid symptomatological reappearance during three steroid tapering attempts and aggravation of his esophageal stenosis to an aphagic stage, requiring a nasogastric tube. This long course of high-dose corticosteroid treatment was complicated with osteoporosis-induced fractures with several spontaneous compressions of thoracolumbar vertebrae requiring an enlarged T10 to L5 cementoplasty.

Its presumed mechanism of action in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) is via immunomodulatory mechanisms, although these remain to be fully elucidated. Intravenous mitoxantrone treatment improved neurological disability and delayed progression of MS in patients with worsening relapsing-remitting (RR) [also termed progressive-relapsing (PR) MS] or secondary-progressive (SP) disease. In a pivotal randomised, double-blind, multicentre trial, mitoxantrone 12 mg/m(2) administered once every 3 months for 2 years provided significant improvements in neurological disability ratings, including Kurtzke Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), Ambulatory Index (AI) and Standardised Neurological Status (SNS) scores, compared with placebo. The drug also significantly reduced the mean number of corticosteroid-treated relapses and prolonged the time to the first treated relapse, with the beneficial effects on disease progression supported by magnetic resonance imaging. Post hoc analyses suggest that the benefits associated with mitoxantrone treatment may be sustained for at least 12 months after cessation of treatment, mean changes from baseline at 36 months in EDSS, AI and SNS scores of 0.10, 0.61 and 0.19, respectively, in the mitoxantrone group versus 0.46, 1.13 and 3.38 with placebo. Concomitant intravenous mitoxantrone 20mg plus intravenous methylprednisolone 1g once every month for 6 months was more effective than intravenous methylprednisolone monotherapy in preventing the development of new gadolinium-enhanced lesions in patients with very active RRMS or SPMS. The drug was generally well tolerated in patients with MS. Adverse events were generally mild to moderate in severity and usually resolved upon discontinuation of treatment or with appropriate pharmacotherapy. At the recommended dosage, mitoxantrone appears to have a low potential to cause cardiotoxicity. In conclusion, intravenous mitoxantrone reduces the relapse rate and slows progression of the disease in patients with worsening RRMS, PRMS or SPMS; thus providing a new option for the management of these patients. The drug was generally well tolerated at the recommended dosage, although potential cardiotoxicity limits the total cumulative dose to 140 mg/m(2). Further studies are warranted to determine which patients with worsening RRMS, PRMS or SPMS are most likely to benefit from mitoxantrone treatment and to more fully define the long-term safety and tolerability of mitoxantrone, including the use of concomitant cardioprotectants to extend the therapeutic lifespan of the drug. Pharmacodynamic Profile. Mitoxantrone, a synthetic anthracenedione derivative, is an established cytotoxic, antineoplastic agent. Its presumed mechanism of action in multiple sclerosis (MS) is immunosuppression. In antineoplastic studies, the drug showed several immunomodulatory effects, inducing macrophage-mediated suppression of B-cell, T-helper and T-cytotoxic lymphocyte function. Currently, the pharmacodynamic properties of mitoxantrone have not been investigated to any extent in patients with MS. In one study, 6 months\' treatment with intravenous mitoxantrone generally had no effect on the distribution of cytokine-positive peripheral blood monocyte cells in patients with MS. In an animal model of the disease, mitoxantrone suppressed the development and progression of both actively and passively induced acute experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE). It appeared to be 10-20 times more effective than cyclophosphamide in the suppression of EAE. Moreover, mitoxantrone approximately doubled the mean time to onset of EAE versus control animals (279 vs 148 days after immunisation; p < 0.00005). In vitro, mitoxantrone 10 and 100 micro g/L inhibited myelin degradation by leucocytes and peritoneal macrophages derived from mice with acute EAE by approximately 60% and 100%. Pharmacokinetic Profile. Currently, there are no published pharmacokinetic data for intravenous mitoxantrone in pitoxantrone in patients with MS, paediatric patients or in those with renal impairment. All studies, to date, have been in patients with cancer receiving a single, approximately 30-minute intravenous infusion of mitoxantrone 5-14 mg/m(2). The drug exhibits triexponential pharmacokinetics, with a rapid initial distribution (alpha) phase, an intermediate distribution (beta) phase and a much slower elimination (gamma) phase. The mean half-life of the alpha phase appears to be 6-12 minutes and that of the beta phase 1.1-3.1 hours. Mitoxantrone has a high affinity for tissue, with a volume of distribution of up to 2248 L/m(2). Mitoxantrone persists for prolonged periods in tissues and was detectable in autopsy tissue from patients who last received the drug up to 272 days before death. At concentrations of 10-10000 ng/mL, the drug was 70-80 % bound to plasma proteins in dogs. Elimination of mitoxantrone occurs predominantly through biliary excretion and may be impaired in patients with hepatic dysfunction or third space abnormalities (e.g. ascites). The mean terminal elimination half-life of mitoxantrone ranged from 23 hours to 215 hours. Renal clearance accounts for 10 % of the total clearance of the drug. Total clearance of mitoxantrone ranged from 13 to 34.2 L/h/m(2) and renal clearance from 0.9 to 2.7 L/h/m(2). The drug appears to have a low potential for interaction with other concomitantly administered agents. Therapeutic Efficacy. Intravenous mitoxantrone (infusion of > or = 5 minutes), either as monotherapy or in combination with intravenous methylprednisolone, delayed the progression of the disease in patients with secondary-progressive (SP) or worsening relapsing-remitting (RR) MS (the latter is also termed progressive-relapsing MS) in comparative, randomised, multicentre trials. In a double-blind, monotherapy trial (Mitoxantrone In Multiple Sclerosis [MIMS] trial), mitoxantrone 12 mg/m(2) (n = 60) once every 3 months for 2 years significantly improved neurological disability relative to placebo (n = 64), as assessed by changes in mean Kurtzke Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score, mean Ambulatory Index (AI) score and mean Standardised Neurological Status (SNS) score. The drug also significantly reduced the mean number of corticosteroid-treated relapses per patient and prolonged the time to the first treated relapse. A Wei-Lachin multivariate analysis of these five efficacy variables indicated that the global difference between the two treatment groups was 0.30 (p < 0.0001). Mitroxantrone was also more effective than placebo according to secondary endpoints in this study, with fewer mitoxantrone recipients experiencing a relapse, a deterioration of > or =1 EDSS point or a confirmed deterioration in EDSS score over a 3-month period. Mitoxantrone recipients also showed less deterioration in quality-of-life ratings and had fewer hospital admissions, whereas more placebo recipients had new gadolinium-enhanced lesions at study end (the latter parameter was assessed using magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] in a subgroup of 110 patients, including 40 patients who received an exploratory 5 mg/m(2) dose). Furthermore, post hoc analyses indicated that the beneficial effects of mitoxantrone treatment on EDSS, SNS and AI scores were sustained for at least 12 months after cessation of treatment, with mean changes from baseline at 36 months in EDSS, AI and SNS scores of 0.10, 0.61 and 0.19, respectively, in the mitoxantrone group versus 0.46, 1.13 and 3.38 with placebo. Preliminary data from a cost-minimisation analysis based on results from the MIMS trial indicated that approximately half of the cost of mitoxantrone was offset by cost savings in other areas associated with the treatment of MS (direct and indirect major costs), with a total annual incremental cost for mitoxantrone of dollar 1661 per patient. Combination therapy once-monthly with intravenous mitoxantrone 20mg plus intravenous methylprednisolone 1g was more effective than intravenous methylprednisolone 1g once every month in preventing the development of gadolinium-enhanced lesions in patients with very active RRMS or SPMS (double-blind assessment using MRI scans). After 6 months, significantly more combination therapy recipients had no new gadolinium-enhanced lesions (90.5% vs 31.3% with monotherapy; p < 0.001) [primary endpoint]. There were also significant reductions in both the mean number of new enhancing lesions and the total number of gadolinium-enhanced lesions in patients receiving combination therapy versus methylprednisolone monotherapy.Tolerability. Mitoxantrone was generally well tolerated in patients with MS. Treatment-emergent adverse events occurring significantly more frequently with mitoxantrone (12 mg/m(2) once every 3 months for 2 years) than placebo were nausea, alopecia, menstrual disorders, urinary tract infection, amenorrhoea, leucopenia and elevated gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase levels. Adverse events were usually mild to moderate in severity and generally resolved with discontinuation of treatment or when treated with appropriate pharmacotherapy. Eight percent of patients discontinued treatment in the mitoxantrone 12 mg/m(2) group due to an adverse event versus 3% of placebo recipients. The incidence of drug-related acute myelogenous leukaemia was very low (0.12%) in a cohort of 802 patients with MS receiving mitoxantrone. Evidence suggests that the risk of cardiotoxicity is low in patients with MS. After 1 year of monotherapy, 3.4% of mitoxantrone recipients had a reduction in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) to < or =50% compared with 0% of placebo recipients; at the end of the second year, respective incidences were 1.9% and 2.9% (total cumulative dose of mitoxantrone per patient was 96 mg/m(2) after 2 years\' treatment).

By contrast, in palliative care patients\' fatigue can be severely debilitating and is often not counteracted with rest, thereby impacting daily activity and quality of life. Fatigue frequently occurs in patients with advanced disease (e.g. cancer-related fatigue) and modalities used to treat cancer can often contribute. Further complicating issues are the multidimensionality, subjective nature and lack of a consensus definition of fatigue. The pathophysiology is not fully understood and evidence-based treatment approaches are needed. To evaluate the efficacy of pharmacological treatments for fatigue in palliative care, with a focus on patients at an advanced stage of disease, including patients with cancer and other chronic diseases. For this update, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, PsycINFO and EMBASE, and a selection of cancer journals up to 28 April 2014. We searched the references of identified articles and contacted authors to obtain unreported data. To validate the search strategy we selected sentinel references. We considered randomised controlled trials (RCTs) concerning adult palliative care with a focus on pharmacological treatment of fatigue compared to placebo, application of two drugs, usual care or a non-pharmacological intervention. The primary outcome had to be non-specific fatigue (or related terms such as asthenia). We did not include studies on fatigue related to antineoplastic treatment (e.g. chemotherapy, radiotherapy, surgical intervention). We also included secondary outcomes that were assessed in fatigue-related studies (e.g. exhaustion, tiredness). Two review authors (MM and MC) independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We screened the search results and included studies if they met the selection criteria. If we identified two or more studies that investigated a specific drug with the same dose in a population with the same disease and using the same assessment instrument or scale, we conducted meta-analysis. In addition, we compared the type of drug investigated in specific populations, as well as the frequent adverse effects of fatigue treatment, by creating overview tables. For this update, we screened 1645 publications of which 45 met the inclusion criteria (20 additional studies to the previous reviews). In total, we analysed data from 18 drugs and 4696 participants. There was a very high degree of statistical and clinical heterogeneity in the trials and we discuss the reasons for this in the review. There were some sources of potential bias in the included studies, including a lack of description of the methods of blinding and allocation concealment, and the small size of the study populations. We included studies investigating pemoline and modafinil in participants with multiple sclerosis (MS)-associated fatigue and methylphenidate in patients suffering from advanced cancer and fatigue in meta-analysis. Treatment results pointed to weak and inconclusive evidence for the efficacy of amantadine, pemoline and modafinil in multiple sclerosis and for carnitine and donepezil in cancer-related fatigue. Methylphenidate and pemoline seem to be effective in patients with HIV, but this is based only on one study per intervention, with only a moderate number of participants in each study. Meta-analysis shows an estimated superior effect for methylphenidate in cancer-related fatigue (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.49, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.15 to 0.83). Therapeutic effects could not be described for dexamphetamine, paroxetine or testosterone. There were a variety of results for the secondary outcomes in some studies. Most studies had low participant numbers and were heterogeneous. In general, adverse reactions were mild and had little or no impact. Based on limited evidence, we cannot recommend a specific drug for the treatment of fatigue in palliative care patients. Fatigue research in palliative care seems to focus on modafinil and methylphenidate, which may be beneficial for the treatment of fatigue associated with palliative care although further research about their efficacy is needed. Dexamethasone, methylprednisolone, acetylsalicylic acid, armodafinil, amantadine and L-carnitine should be further examined. Consensus is needed regarding fatigue outcome parameters for clinical trials.","IncludeStatus":"Exclude","LisedInColA":"No Label","originalFormulation":"No Label","AloneOrComb":"No Label","cancerType":"No Label","studyType":"No Label","therapeuticAssociation":"No Label"},{"id":"703","Drug":"Methylprednisolone","PMID":"31799150","Title":"Vedolizumab in combined immune checkpoint therapy-induced infliximab-refractory colitis in a patient with metastatic melanoma: A case report","Authors":"Randhawa M, Gaughran G, Archer C, Pavli P, Morey A, Ali S, Yip D.","Citation":"World J Clin Oncol. 2019 Oct 24;10(10):350-357. doi: 10.5306/wjco.v10.i10.350.","CreatedDate":"12/5/19","Abstract":"Dual checkpoint inhibition improves response rates in treatment na\xefve patients with metastatic melanoma compared to monotherapy.

The disease is habitually limited to the skin, but it can virtually involve any organ. Nevertheless, no prior cases of PG involving the thyroid bed have ever been reported. <b>Case Report:</b> A bilateral PG of the breast was diagnosed in a 51-year-old woman and treated with intravenous methylprednisolone pulse-therapy and cyclosporine, with partial improvement. During the hospitalization, cytological examination of two hypoechoic thyroid nodules by fine-needle aspiration (FNA) was consistent with thyroid carcinoma. After total thyroidectomy, histopathology confirmed a papillary thyroid cancer (PTC), and radioactive iodine ablation was performed. At 12-month ultrasonographic follow-up, two hypoechoic avascular areas localized in the empty thyroid bed raised the suspect of PTC recurrence. However, (i) undetectable levels of thyroglobulin without anti-thyroglobulin antibodies, (ii) neutrophilia and increased inflammatory marker levels, and (iii) cytological examination of FNA showing numerous neutrophils induced to suspect thyroid bed PG infiltration. An <i>ex juvantibus</i> approach with high-dose methylprednisolone led to dimensional reduction of the hypoechoic areas on ultrasonography, thus confirming the hypothesis of thyroid bed PG. <b>Conclusion:</b> This case of thyroid bed PG supports the idea that PG reflects a cutaneous phenotype encompassed in the spectrum of systemic neutrophilic diseases. Endocrinologists should be aware that thyroid bed PG involvement is an albeit rare differential diagnosis to consider in patients who had undergone thyroid surgery, especially with a history of PG.","IncludeStatus":"Exclude","LisedInColA":"No Label","originalFormulation":"No Label","AloneOrComb":"No Label","cancerType":"No Label","studyType":"No Label","therapeuticAssociation":"No Label"},{"id":"705","Drug":"Methylprednisolone","PMID":"10745259","Title":"Does early treatment with high-dose methylprednisolone alter the course of hepatic regimen-related toxicity?","Authors":"Khoury H, Adkins D, Brown R, Trinkaus K, Vij R, Miller G, Goodnough LT, DiPersio J.","Citation":"Bone Marrow Transplant. 2000 Apr;25(7):737-43. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1702209.","CreatedDate":"4/4/00","Abstract":"Hepatic regimen-related toxicity (RRT) is a serious complication of stem cell transplantation. Cytokine activation may be involved in the pathogenesis. Corticosteroids are potent inhibitors of cytokine production, and, therefore could play a role in the treatment of hepatic RRT. Between January 1994 and June 1998, 28 of 782 consecutive transplant patients (3.6%) developed hepatic RRT (20 veno-occlusive disease (VOD) and eight liver dysfunction of uncertain etiology (LDUE) as defined by Seattle criteria), and were treated with high-dose methylprednisolone (MP, 500 mg/m2 i.v. every 12 h for six doses), initiated upon increase in serum total bilirubin to > or =4 mg/dl. Other causes of liver dysfunction were excluded. Response to therapy with high-dose MP was defined as reduction in total bilirubin by 50% within 10 days of initiation of MP. Overall, 17 patients (61%) responded to treatment (12 patients with VOD, five patients with LDUE). The bilirubin in responding patients decreased from a mean of 8.6 mg/dl (range, 4-17.9) at the start of MP to 4.1 mg/dl (range, 0.5-17.9) 10 days later. There were no statistically significant differences between responders and non-responders in the day treatment with high-dose MP was initiated (P = 0.38), total serum bilirubin (P = 0.17) and percent weight gain at the time high-dose MP was started (P = 0.10) or the calculated probability of fatal outcome from VOD (18% for responders, 23% for non-responders; P = 0.30). A lower pre-transplant DLCOc was observed among non-responders (P = 0.04). At 100 days post-transplant, hepatic RRT resolved in all 13 survivors who responded to high-dose MP, and in one non-responding patient. No serious toxicities due to high-dose MP were observed. We conclude that resolution of hepatic RRT occurred in the majority of patients treated with high-dose MP in this study; however, randomized controlled trials are required to determine the efficacy of high-dose MP for treatment of hepatic RRT.","IncludeStatus":"Exclude","LisedInColA":"No Label","originalFormulation":"No Label","AloneOrComb":"No Label","cancerType":"No Label","studyType":"No Label","therapeuticAssociation":"No Label"},{"id":"706","Drug":"Methylprednisolone","PMID":"22295154","Title":"Acquired hemophilia associated with bullous pemphigoid: a case report","Authors":"Qiu X, Zhang G, Xiao R, Zhang J, Zhou Y, Li G, Yan K, Lu Q.","Citation":"Int J Clin Exp Pathol. 2012;5(1):102-4.

A single cycle of alemtuzumab, administered over 5 days, depletes lymphocytes. Reconstitution causes prolonged alterations in the lymphocyte repertoire, with relatively increased regulatory T-cell numbers and reduced na\xefve T cells. It is currently approved for the treatment of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia and is being considered for licensing for multiple sclerosis (MS).When first used, alemtuzumab successfully reduced relapses and new lesion formation based on magnetic resonance imaging in people with progressive MS, but this cohort continued to accumulate disability, associated with progressive cerebral atrophy, presumably due to axonal degeneration. From this experience, we advocated that immunotherapies should be given early in the course of the disease. Since then, one phase II and two phase III trials have shown that alemtuzumab reduces the relapse rate, compared with the active comparator interferon beta-1a (IFN\u03b2-1a), in treatment-na\xefve and treatment-experienced MS up to 10 years from disease onset. Furthermore, in two of these trials, alemtuzumab reduced the risk of accumulating disability compared with IFN\u03b2-1a; indeed alemtuzumab treatment led to an improvement in disability and reduction in cerebral atrophy. Safety issues are infusion-associated reactions, mainly controlled by methyl-prednisolone, antihistamines, and antipyretics; mild to moderate infections; and autoimmunity. After 5 years, 30 to 40% of alemtuzumab patients have developed autoimmunity, largely against the thyroid gland, but rarely (2%) against platelets in immune thrombocytopenia, and in a few cases, Goodpasture\'s renal syndrome.Alemtuzumab is an effective therapy for early relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, offering disability improvement at least to 5 years after treatment. Its use requires careful monitoring so that potentially serious side effects can be treated early and effectively.","IncludeStatus":"Exclude","LisedInColA":"No Label","originalFormulation":"No Label","AloneOrComb":"No Label","cancerType":"No Label","studyType":"No Label","therapeuticAssociation":"No Label"},{"id":"711","Drug":"Methylprednisolone","PMID":"29719744","Title":"An Unusual Presentation of Primary Hepatic Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma of the Liver","Authors":"Dhingra R, Winter MW, Yilmaz OH, Jaiswal S, Sterling M.","Citation":"Cureus. 2018 Feb 27;10(2):e2242. doi: 10.7759/cureus.2242.","CreatedDate":"5/3/18","Abstract":"This report describes a case of primary hepatic diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) in a 64-year-old male who presented with constitutional symptoms, jaundice, abdominal swelling, and right upper quadrant pain.

Clinical studies suggest a rate of 5% and autopsy results a rate of more than 25% of central nervous system (CNS) involvement in sarcoidosis. Statistical analysis of 57,789 patients admitted to the Department of Medicine in Lucerne over an 11-year period revealed 51 patients (0.9/1000) with the diagnosis of sarcoidosis. Six of these (12%) had sarcoidosis affecting the CNS. Neurosarcoidosis presented as: leptomeningeal granulomas, cranial nerve palsy, hypothalamic-pituitary syndrome, diabetes insipidus, pareses, paresthesia, pyramidal signs, dementia, urine retention, and asymptomatic granulomas. Neurosarcoidosis has predilections for the base of the brain, cranial nerves (facial nerve palsy is the most common) and meninges, but any part of the CNS may be affected. Therefore, the diagnosis of neurosarcoidosis may be extremely difficult, especially when it occurs as an isolated finding. Positive findings in transbronchial biopsy and lavage may demonstrate asymptomatic pulmonary involvement in as many as 50% of patients with neurosarcoidosis. Angiotensin-converting enzyme levels may be raised in the blood or cerebrospinal fluid in some 50% of cases. Kveim test has a low sensitivity in neurosarcoidosis and thus is of little use. Gallium uptake may demonstrate extracranial granuloma available for biopsy. All these tests, and also computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, may be helpful. However, when in selected cases with isolated CNS disease standard investigations are not conclusive, meningeal or cerebral biopsy may be required in order to exclude other causes such as other granulomatous disorders, tumor metastasis, lymphoma, vasculitis, Sj\xf6gren syndrome, infection, neurologic disease such as multiple sclerosis, or systemic diseases such as Whipple\'s disease. CNS involvement in the acute phase of the disease has a favorable prognosis, while chronic courses respond less well to therapy. Treatment is initiated most frequently with corticosteroids (0.5-1 mg/kg body weight/day or pulses of 1 g/day of methylprednisolone in severe cases). Improvement is seen within 1-2 months. Side effects of corticosteroids, aggressive disease or frequent recurrences may require other immunosuppressive drugs (methotrexate, azathioprine, chlorambucil, cyclosporine A).

Two weeks after tumor removal, she started following simple commands and progressive improvement, although she remained on mechanical ventilation for 10 weeks due to nocturnal central hypoventilation. Anti-NMDAR antibodies in serum/CSF were detected. Pathological examination showed immature teratoma with foci of infiltrates of B- and T-cells.

Corticosteroids are usually stopped between 6 and 12 months after LT, except for patients whose transplantations were necessitated by autoimmune disease. ACN and mycophenolate must be monitored to verify the dose, with a residual blood assay (for tacrolimus), at 2hours (for cyclosporine microemulsion), or by a simplified area under the curve (for mycophenolate). The first-line treatment for rejection calls for increasing the dosage of tacrolimus (or switching to tacrolimus for patients treated with cyclosporine). Second-line treatment for refractory rejection is corticosteroid bolus (500-1000 mg of methylprednisolone, one to three times). Antibodies blocking the interleukin 2 receptors (basiliximab) or lymphocytes (thymoglobulin) make it possible to reduce the incidence of rejection, decrease corticosteroid doses rapidly and introduce ACN later on (useful in cases of kidney failure). The mTOR inhibitors (sirolimus and everolimus) have different side effects (hyperlipidemia, thrombocytopenia, and pulmonary, cutaneous, and articular events) than ACNs. The absence of any renal or vascular effect is interesting for patients with kidney failure, and the antiproliferative effect can be useful for patients transplanted because of cancer. The current objective of immunosuppression is to reduce the adverse effects (kidney failure, metabolic complications, cancer and infections, in particular, which reduce the survival of patients and grafts), and in the future, to promote the establishment of tolerance that ideally will allow the patient to stop prophylactic immunosuppressant treatment. New chemical agents, capable of acting on new and more specific pathways, are in phase II/III testing.","IncludeStatus":"Exclude","LisedInColA":"No Label","originalFormulation":"No Label","AloneOrComb":"No Label","cancerType":"No Label","studyType":"No Label","therapeuticAssociation":"No Label"},{"id":"736","Drug":"Methylprednisolone","PMID":"16237711","Title":"Langerhans\' cell histiocytosis after living donor liver transplantation: report of a case","Authors":"Honda R, Ohno Y, Iwasaki T, Okudaira S, Okada M, Kamitamari A, Ohshima K, Moriuchi H, Kanematsu T.","Citation":"Liver Transpl. 2005 Nov;11(11):1435-8. doi: 10.1002/lt.20589.","CreatedDate":"10/21/05","Abstract":"We report a case of Langerhans\' cell histiocytosis (LCH) occurring after a living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) for fulminant hepatitis.

The lesion was characterized by superficial ulceration, an intermediate layer of granulation tissue and a deep portion containing vertically orientated capillaries and perpendicularly arranged fibroblasts and collagen.

The lesion regressed in 10 days, but recurred after 3 months following severe self-trauma. Hypertrophic scars and keloids are two types of exuberant scarring reported in human beings, the pathogenesis of which is still unclear but seems to involve several cytokines, growth factors and inflammatory cells. The histological features identified in this case paralleled those reported in hypertrophic scars in humans.

Local treatment may be sufficient for mild cases, while for severe cases systemic immunosuppressants are the mainstay (1,2). We report the case of a patient with bullous PG and UC successfully treated with infliximab and azathioprine. A 32-year-old male Caucasian patient presented with painful violaceous vesicles and enlarging bullae of various sizes and with acute onset, located on the trunk and bilaterally on both the lower and the upper extremities. Lesions on the trunk were composed of hemorrhagic pustules with a surrounding erythematous overhanging border. Some of the lesions had undergone central necrosis and ulceration (Figure 1, a-d). The patient reported of the lesions had appeared one week ago, simultaneously with the exacerbation of a known inflammatory bowel disease with hemorrhagic mucoid diarrhea and fever of up to 38.5\xb0C. The patient\'s medical history included UC affecting the whole colon (pancolitis), diagnosed 5 months prior to the onset of the epidermal lesions, for which the patient was receiving treatment with oral prednisolone 10 mg/day and mesalazine granules. Blood tests showed severe anemia, leukocytosis, and increased inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate). Antinuclear antibodies (ANA), anti-double stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) andtibodies, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (cANCA), perinuclear neutrophil antibodies (p-ANCA), antiphospholipid antibodies, and tumor markers were within normal limits. The patient was negative for cryoglobulins, viral hepatitis (B, C) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Blood cultures were negative. Microscopy and cultures for mycobacteria and fungi gave negative results. Stool samples tested negative for infections agents. The Mantoux skin test was negative. Colonoscopy showed severe pancolitis, and biopsies from the rectum and sigmoid colon were consistent with chronic ulcerative colitis. Abdominal ultrasound and chest and abdominal X-rays did not result in significant findings. Because of severe anemia, the patient received 2 blood transfusions. The histopathologic examination carried out on the erythematous border of a lesion on the lower leg showed a neutrophilic infiltrate, confined to the dermis. On the basis of clinical findings, the diagnosis of PG was established. Topical wound care consisted of local wound care and a topical corticosteroid. Systemic therapy was initiated with 40 mg/day methylprednisolone for 7 days, 30 mg/day for 7 days, then 25 mg/day, and then tapered down further. The patient received an infusion of infliximab 7.5 mg/kg at weeks 0, 2, and 6 and every 8 weeks thereafter. After week 2, oral azathioprine 2.5 mg/kg daily was added to the treatment. The patient also received mesalazine tablets (2 g \xd72/day) and mesalazine enema (1-2/day). The patient showed good response to treatment, with clinical remission of skin lesions. Lesions healed with characteristic thin, atrophic scars (Figure 2, a-d). At 7-month follow-up the patient was continuing with infusions of infliximab 7.5 mg/kg and azathioprine 2.5 mg/kg and was still in remission. We reported our experience with a case of generalized bullous pyoderma gangrenosum associated with ulcerative colitis. Generalized pyoderma gangrenosum is very rare. Bullous or atypical PG was first described by Perry and Winklemann in 1972 (1). Brunsting et al. coined the term pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) to describe a series of patients with recurrent ulcerations (3). The incidence of this disease is uncertain. Its pathogenesis is unknown, but an immunological background has been suggested. In approximately 50% of patients, an underlying immunological disease is present, commonly inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) (4-6). In larger series of patients with PG, approximately 50% present with a primary disorder. Ulcerative colitis is found in 10-15% of cases. Crohn\'s disease is associated with PG closed than UC. Less than 3% of patients with Crohn\'s disease or UC develop PG (6). PG is characterized by cutaneous ulcerations with mucopurulent or hemorrhagic exudate. It begins as an inflammatory pustule with a surrounding halo that enlarges and begins to ulcerate. These very painful ulcers present with undermined bluish borders with surrounding erythema. The lesions of PG most commonly occur on the legs, but they may occur anywhere on the body. The clinical picture of PG is very characteristic. Therefore the diagnosis of PG is based firstly on clinical signs and on the patient\'s history of underlying diseases and then supported by biopsy. PG has four distinctive clinical and histological variants. Some have morphological and histological features that overlap with other reactive neutrophilic skin conditions. There are no diagnostic serologic features (6,7). There is no evidence that the efficacy of treatment strategies for PG differs between IBD and non-IBD patients. For patients with a diffuse disease or rapidly progressive process, systemic treatment is essential. Immunosuppression is the mainstay of treatment. Traditionally, the most commonly used drugs with the best clinical experience are systemic corticosteroids. Corticosteroids have been considered as first line treatment (6,8). As reported by the European Crohn\'s and Colitis Organisation (ECCO) in 2008, an evidence-based consensus on the management of special situations in patients with ulcerative colitis, systemic corticosteroids are recommended (9). Treatment with corticosteroids (e.g. prednisolone 1-2 mg per kg/day or pulse therapy with 1 g of methylprednisolone) aims to prevent progression and rapidly stop inflammation (6). Additional mesalamine and corticosteroids may be effective in patients with bowel disease (10). In recent years, tumor necrosis alpha (TNF-\u03b1) inhibitors, such as infliximab and adalimumab, were reported to be effective for PG associated with IBD. These drugs block the biological activity of TNF-\u03b1, which effects regulatory T cells, restoring their capacity to inhibit cytokine production. The TNF-\u03b1 inhibitors thus suppress the inflammatory processes that is involved in the pathogenesis of PG (11). Infliximab, a chimeric monoclonal antibody, is given by infusion at weeks 0, 2, and 6 and then every 8 weeks, usually at a dosage of 5 mg/kg. UC of patients with frequent disease relapse or those that are resistant or dependent on corticosteroids is often treated with purine antimetabolites, such as azathioprine (AZA) (10). AZA, a purine antimetabolite (2.5 mg per kg/day) is administered for its steroid-sparing effects. The response occurs after 2 to 4 weeks (6, 10). Infliximab can be combined with AZA. Patients with UC treated with infliximab plus AZA were more likely to achieve corticosteroid-free remission at 16 weeks than those receiving either monotherapy (10,12).

The characteristic appearance of lymphadenopathy is described as intense, paracortical immunoblastic hyperplasia. Changes in light microscopy may resemble lymphoma, but immunohistochemistry reveals a benign polyclonal B cell hyperplasia. We describe a 67-year-old Sri Lankan woman who manifested relapsing prolonged fever, raised inflammatory markers, arthralgia, myalgia, transient skin rash, and cervical lymphadenopathy histologically characterized by noncaseating granulomatous adenitis with central suppuration. Due to the fact of high prevalence of tuberculosis in the region, an extensive diagnostic evaluation was done to exclude the possibility of extrapulmonary tuberculosis; unsuccessful therapeutic trials of complete antituberculosis regime reliably excluded the possibility of tuberculosis and strengthened the diagnostic validity. Disease flares were characterized by systemic inflammatory response syndrome with immediate clinical and laboratory response to corticosteroids. After systematic diagnostic workup which ruled out possible malignant, rheumatic, or autoimmune diseases and infections previously described as causes of granulomatous adenitis, our patient was diagnosed as having adult onset Still\'s disease based on Yamaguchi criteria. She required a trial of indomethacin followed by methylprednisolone pulse therapy and long-term maintenance steroid therapy without steroid-sparing immunosuppressive agents or biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs. She achieved full disease remission in 3\xa0months. Reevaluation after 6\xa0months and 1\xa0year did not reveal residual disease activity. To the best of our knowledge this is the first report of suppurative noncaseating granulomatous lymphadenitis attributed to adult onset Still\'s disease among Asian or South Asian ethnicities and it is also rarely reported among Europeans and North Americans. It is an extremely challenging situation to diagnose Still\'s disease with granulomatous lymphadenitis where tuberculosis is highly prevalent. This case highlights the importance of consideration of adult onset Still\'s disease as a potential diagnosis in a compatible clinical context in the presence of noncaseating granulomatous adenitis and indicates that one should not be misled into a diagnosis of tuberculosis by the fact of the high prevalence of tuberculosis, however, the exclusion of other diagnoses is a prerequisite.","IncludeStatus":"Exclude","LisedInColA":"No Label","originalFormulation":"No Label","AloneOrComb":"No Label","cancerType":"No Label","studyType":"No Label","therapeuticAssociation":"No Label"},{"id":"751","Drug":"Methylprednisolone","PMID":"22802479","Title":"Successful response to intravenous immunoglobulin as rescue therapy in a patient with Hashimoto\'s encephalopathy","Authors":"Cornejo R, Venegas P, Go\u221a\xb1i D, Salas A, Romero C.","Citation":"BMJ Case Rep. 2010 Dec 29;2010:bcr0920103332. doi: 10.1136/bcr.09.2010.3332.","CreatedDate":"7/18/12","Abstract":"The authors describe the case of a 61-year-old woman who was admitted to our intensive care unit (ICU) due to impaired consciousness associated with generalised seizures.

Existing recommendations for optimal management of toxicities vary according to organ systems affected and grading. Grade\xa01 toxicities (exception to the rule: neurologic, hematologic, cardiac manifestation) require close monitoring.

Three trials used biologic monotherapy, that is, without MTX. There were no trials with placebo-only comparators and no trials of tofacitinib. Trial duration ranged from 6 to 24 months. Half of the trials contained participants with early RA (less than two years\' duration) and the other half included participants with established RA (2 to 10 years). Biologic + MTX versus active comparator (MTX (17 trials (6344 participants)/MTX + methylprednisolone 2 trials (141 participants))In traditional meta-analyses, there was moderate-quality evidence downgraded for inconsistency that biologics with MTX were associated with statistically significant and clinically meaningful benefit versus comparator as demonstrated by ACR50 (American College of Rheumatology scale) and RA remission rates. For ACR50, biologics with MTX showed a risk ratio (RR) of 1.40 (95% CI 1.30 to 1.49), absolute difference of 16% (95% CI 13% to 20%) and NNTB = 7 (95% CI 6 to 8). For RA remission rates, biologics with MTX showed a RR of 1.62 (95% CI 1.33 to 1.98), absolute difference of 15% (95% CI 11% to 19%) and NNTB = 5 (95% CI 6 to 7). Biologics with MTX were also associated with a statistically significant, but not clinically meaningful, benefit in physical function (moderate-quality evidence downgraded for inconsistency), with an improvement of HAQ scores of -0.10 (95% CI -0.16 to -0.04 on a 0 to 3 scale), absolute difference -3.3% (95% CI -5.3% to -1.3%) and NNTB = 4 (95% CI 2 to 15).We did not observe evidence of differences between biologics with MTX compared to MTX for radiographic progression (low-quality evidence, downgraded for imprecision and inconsistency) or serious adverse events (moderate-quality evidence, downgraded for imprecision). Based on low-quality evidence, results were inconclusive for withdrawals due to adverse events (RR of 1.32, but 95% confidence interval included possibility of important harm, 0.89 to 1.97). Results for cancer were also inconclusive (Peto OR 0.71, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.33) and downgraded to low-quality evidence for serious imprecision. Biologic without MTX versus active comparator (MTX 3 trials (866 participants)There was no evidence of statistically significant or clinically important differences for ACR50, HAQ, remission, (moderate-quality evidence for these benefits, downgraded for imprecision), withdrawals due to adverse events,and serious adverse events (low-quality evidence for these harms, downgraded for serious imprecision). All studies were for TNF biologic monotherapy and none for non-TNF biologic monotherapy. Radiographic progression was not measured. In MTX-naive RA participants, there was moderate-quality evidence that, compared with MTX alone, biologics with MTX was associated with absolute and relative clinically meaningful benefits in three of the efficacy outcomes (ACR50, HAQ scores, and RA remission rates). A benefit regarding less radiographic progression with biologics with MTX was not evident (low-quality evidence). We found moderate- to low-quality evidence that biologic therapy with MTX was not associated with any higher risk of serious adverse events compared with MTX, but results were inconclusive for withdrawals due to adverse events and cancer to 24 months.TNF biologic monotherapy did not differ statistically significantly or clinically meaningfully from MTX for any of the outcomes (moderate-quality evidence), and no data were available for non-TNF biologic monotherapy.We conclude that biologic with MTX use in MTX-naive populations is beneficial and that there is little/inconclusive evidence of harms. More data are needed for tofacitinib, radiographic progression and harms in this patient population to fully assess comparative efficacy and safety.","IncludeStatus":"Exclude","LisedInColA":"No Label","originalFormulation":"No Label","AloneOrComb":"No Label","cancerType":"No Label","studyType":"No Label","therapeuticAssociation":"No Label"},{"id":"757","Drug":"Methylprednisolone","PMID":"25124898","Title":"[Analysis of the curative effect of ABO-incompatible liver transplantation in the treatment in patients with acute severe liver disease]","Authors":"Shen Z, Deng Y, Zheng H, Pan C, Zhang Y, Jiang W, Zhang J, Gao W, Huai M, Shi R.","Citation":"Zhonghua Wei Zhong Bing Ji Jiu Yi Xue. 2014 Aug;26(8):529-33. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.issn.2095-4352.2014.08.001.","CreatedDate":"8/16/14","Abstract":"To analyze and evaluate the clinical effect of ABO-incompatible liver transplantation in the treatment of acute severe liver disease. A retrospective clinical study was conducted. The clinical data of 4 136 patients undergoing orthotopic liver transplantation in Organ Transplantation Center of Tianjin First Center Hospital from September 1999 to December 2013 were analyzed. The criteria of patients enrolled were as following: model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score \u2265 20, the donor\'s and recipient\'s blood types were different, age 18-70 years, and undergone primary non-bypass orthotopic liver transplantation. According to the rate of compliance with the principles of blood transfusion, the cases were divided into two groups: ABO-compatible group (ABO-C group, n=41), ABO-incompatible group (ABO-I group, n=22). The patients in ABO-I group received basiliximab + methylprednisolone for immune induction therapy during operation, basiliximab + tacrolimus + mycophenolate + cortisol as quadruple immunosuppressive regimen after operation. They also received subcutaneous injection of low molecular heparin for anticoagulant therapy after operation, and oral warfarin or aspirin and clopidogrel bisulfate instead after 7 days. They also received routine alprostadil after operation. The remaining treatment was the same as that of ABO-C group. The clinical data, postoperative complications, rejection and survival rates of two groups were statistically analyzed. There were no significant differences in gender, age, MELD score, complicated with tumor, quality of donor liver, length of cold preservation of donor liver, duration of operation, and blood loss during operation between ABO-C and ABO-I groups. Number of splenectomy during operation was significantly higher in ABO-I group than that in ABO-C group (5 cases vs. 1 case, \u03c7\xb2 = 4.687, P=0.030). The 3-month, 6-month, 1-year, 3-year and 5-year survival rates of ABO-C group were 89.5%, 78.3%, 72.5%, 69.1% and 61.8%, respectively, while those of ABO-I group were 78.9%, 72.9%, 65.6%, 56.2% and 46.8%, respectively. There was no significant difference in the cumulative survival rate between two groups (Log Rank, \u03c7\xb2 = 0.647, df=1, P=0.421). The postoperative infection rate in ABO-I group was significantly higher than that of ABO-C group [63.6% (14/22) vs. 31.7% (13/41), \u03c7\xb2 = 5.960, P=0.015]. There were no significant difference in postoperative complications of biliary tract [22.7% (5/22) vs. 12.2% (5/41), \u03c7\xb2 = 0.531, P=0.466], vascular complications [31.8% (7/22) vs. 12.2% (5/41), \u03c7\xb2 = 2.416, P=0.120], or rejection as diagnosed by pathology [22.7% (5/22) vs. 9.8% (4/41), \u03c7\xb2 = 1.051, P=0.305] between ABO-I and ABO-C groups. Although ABO-incompatible liver transplantation was followed by higher postoperative infection rate and perioperative mortality, ABO-incompatible liver transplantation can still be used to save the patient with acute severe liver disease as there is a shortage of compatible donor at present.","IncludeStatus":"Exclude","LisedInColA":"No Label","originalFormulation":"No Label","AloneOrComb":"No Label","cancerType":"No Label","studyType":"No Label","therapeuticAssociation":"No Label"},{"id":"758","Drug":"Methylprednisolone","PMID":"29145318","Title":"An unusual cause of fever of unknown origin with enlarged lymph nodes-relapsing polychondritis: A case report","Authors":"Liu W, Jiang H, Jing H, Mao B.","Citation":"Medicine (Baltimore). 2017 Nov;96(46):e8734. doi: 10.1097/MD.0000000000008734.","CreatedDate":"11/18/17","Abstract":"Fever of unknown origin (FUO) is a common initial presentation leading to a diagnostic challenge.

Enhanced computed tomography (CT) scans of his chest showed a remarkable progressive enlargement of bilateral cervical, supraclavicular, hilar, and mediastinal lymph nodes within 2 weeks. Bronchofibroscopy manifested obvious luminal stenosis with swelling, thick pale mucosa, and disappearing of structures of trachea cricoid cartilage, followed by a 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron-emission tomography-computed tomography (18F-FDG PET/CT) with intense symmetric FDG uptake in larynx, tracheobronchial tree, and hilar, mediastinal, and axillary lymph nodes being demonstrated. A diagnosis of relapsing polychondritis (RP) was finally reached. The patient received methylprednisolone 40\u200amg daily with a gradual tapering in a 4-month follow-up. The patient experienced no relapse of fever and lymph nodes enlargement in the 4-month follow-up. Even though long-term fever with multiple lymphadenectasis usually lead to a diagnosis of lymphoma, the bronchoscopic features and evidence from 18F-FDG PET/CT in this case were much more approximate to RP, indicating an importance of a sensible differential diagnosis of RP in patients who present with nonspecific features such as FUO and lymph nodes enlargement. Keeping a high index of clinical suspicion in these patients can help recognize uncommon of RP and promote diagnosis and treatment. Our case highlights the significance of 18F-FDG PET/CT in helping reaching the diagnosis of RP in this condition. This report provides new data regarding the diagnostic difficulties of this rare type of autoimmune disease, and further investigations are needed as cases accumulate.","IncludeStatus":"Exclude","LisedInColA":"No Label","originalFormulation":"No Label","AloneOrComb":"No Label","cancerType":"No Label","studyType":"No Label","therapeuticAssociation":"No Label"},{"id":"759","Drug":"Methylprednisolone","PMID":"12708051","Title":"[Successful use of etoposide in an elderly patient with chronic recurrent hemophagocytic syndrome]","Authors":"Ogasawara T, Kawauchi K, Yasuyama M, Ohkawa S.","Citation":"Nihon Ronen Igakkai Zasshi. 2003 Mar;40(2):160-6. doi: 10.3143/geriatrics.40.160.","CreatedDate":"4/24/03","Abstract":"A 66-year-old man was admitted to our hospital for fever on January 19, 1998.

Therefore, we introduce a noninvasive diagnostic technique using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) for patients suspected to have MIL. A 45-year-old woman had been treated for 12 weeks with levamisole and 5-FU for adenocarcinoma of the cecum, when she complained of ataxia, diplopia and left ptosis. Brain MRI showed a nodular enhancing lesion in the left midbrain, using gadolinium enhanced T1-weighted imaging, and scattered multiple white matter lesions throughout the cerebral hemisphere. Instead of a brain biopsy, DTI was performed that revealed reduced fractional anisotropy (FA) and increased radial diffusivity (RD) in the left midbrain lesion compared with the right midbrain denoting demyelination. Levamisole and 5-FU were discontinued, and she received intravenously 1\xa0g of methylprednisolone daily for 5 d. After five weeks, follow-up DTI showed an increased FA and decreased RD, signifying the reversibility. DTI therefore may provide valuable information on diagnosing MIL and assessing the treatment response.

Before and after cardiopulmonary bypass, plasma interleukin-10 and tumor necrosis factor alpha were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and lymphocyte subsets in peripheral blood by flow cytometry. Relative values (post-/pre-CPB) of interleukin-10 and tumor necrosis factor alpha were calculated. The cardiac index (CI) was measured continuously beat-to-beat by a pulse contour analysis (PiCCO). Children above the cutoff value (median cardiac index value 3.0 l min(-1) m(-2)) were designated as the normal CI group and those below this value as the low CI group. In the normal CI group the relative values of interleukin-10 remained almost seven times higher than pre-CPB values at 24 h while in the low CI group they decreased almost to pre-CPB values. Furthermore, the normal CI group, but not the low CI group, exhibited more than threefold decrease in T-lymphocytes (lymphocyte T-cells, T-helper cells, and cytotoxic T-cells) 24 h after CPB.

The patient developed gradually worsening dyspnea five weeks after an initiation of temsirolimus and was admitted to our facility. On his admission, although a pulmonary function test revealed a decreased diffusion capacity, there was no obvious progression of ILD on HRCT scan. His dyspnea once improved after discontinuation of temsirolimus, but it recurred and acute exacerbation of ILD was diagnosed 40 days after his last administration of temsirolimus. He received high-dose steroid therapy, however, he deteriorated and died. Histopathological examination of the lungs at autopsy revealed overlapping diffuse alveolar damage with chronic interstitial changes. In the present case, since there were no specific factors that could have caused acute exacerbation of ILD except for temsirolimus, it was considered to contribute to the exacerbation of underlying ILD. In conclusion, physicians should be aware of the possibility of temsirolimus-induced ILD not only while the medication is administered, but also even after it is discontinued.

Abdominal examination of the patient revealed an ill-defined mass in the right iliac fossa and visible peristalsis. An abdominal computed tomographic scan and barium enema study confirmed a complex ascending colonic and cecal tumor. The patient underwent exploratory laparotomy. The intraoperative finding was a huge complex inflammatory mass involving the cecum, terminal ileum, and sigmoid colon. He subsequently had sigmoidectomy with end-to-end sigmoidorectal anastomosis and a cecal resection, and the proximal ascending colon was exteriorized because end mucoid fistula and terminal ileostomy were performed. The histopathological diagnosis confirmed Crohn\'s disease. The patient subsequently received five courses of adjuvant chemotherapy consisting of azathioprine, methotrexate, mesalamine, and methylprednisolone. He had complete disease remission and subsequently had closure of ileostomy with satisfactory postoperative status.

Timely delivery of specialized care has reduced mortality; however, long-term neurological recovery continues to be limited. In recent years, a number of exciting neuroprotective and regenerative strategies have emerged and have come under active investigation in clinical trials, and several more are coming down the translational pipeline. Among ongoing trials are RISCIS (riluzole), INSPIRE (Neuro-Spinal Scaffold), MASC (minocycline), and SPRING (VX-210). Microstructural MRI techniques have improved our ability to image the injured spinal cord at high resolution. This innovation, combined with serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, holds the promise of providing a quantitative biomarker readout of spinal cord neural tissue injury, which may improve prognostication and facilitate stratification of patients for enrollment into clinical trials. Given evidence of the effectiveness of early surgical decompression and growing recognition of the concept that \\"time is spine,\\" infrastructural changes at a systems level are being implemented in many regions around the world to provide a streamlined process for transfer of patients with acute SCI to a specialized unit. With the continued aging of the population, central cord syndrome is soon expected to become the most common form of acute traumatic SCI; characterization of the pathophysiology, natural history, and optimal treatment of these injuries is hence a key public health priority. Collaborative international efforts have led to the development of clinical practice guidelines for traumatic SCI based on robust evaluation of current evidence. The current article provides an in-depth review of progress in SCI, covering the above areas.","IncludeStatus":"Exclude","LisedInColA":"No Label","originalFormulation":"No Label","AloneOrComb":"No Label","cancerType":"No Label","studyType":"No Label","therapeuticAssociation":"No Label"},{"id":"767","Drug":"Oseltamivir","PMID":"31215284","Title":"A prospective study on the epidemiology and clinical significance of viral respiratory infections among pediatric oncology patients","Authors":"Vliora C, Papadakis V, Doganis D, Tourkantoni N, Paisiou A, Kottaridi C, Kourlamba G, Zaoutis T, Kosmidis H, Kattamis A, Polychronopoulou S, Goussetis E, Giannouli G, Syridou G, Priftis K, Papaevangelou V.","Citation":"Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2019 Apr;36(3):173-186. doi: 10.1080/08880018.2019.1613462.

However, there is still a gap in the literature, regarding the epidemiology of viral respiratory infections in children with cancer. We prospectively enrolled 224 patients, from September 2012 to August 2015. The cohort included children with hematologic or solid malignancies receiving chemotherapy, or undergoing hemopoietic stem cell transplantation, outpatients/inpatients exhibiting signs/symptoms of febrile/afebrile upper/lower respiratory infection. Viral infection was diagnosed by detection of \u22651 viruses from a sample at time of enrollment, using the CLART<sup>\xae</sup><i>PneumoVir</i> kit (GENOMICA, Spain). \u0391 detailed questionnaire including demographics and medical history was also completed. Samples were processed in batches, results were communicated as soon as they became available. Children recruited in whom no virus was detected composed the no virus detected group. Viral prevalence was 38.4% in children presenting with respiratory illness. A single virus was found in 30.4%, with RSV being the most frequent. Viral coinfections were detected in 8%. Children with viral infection were more likely to be febrile upon enrollment and to present with lower respiratory signs/symptoms. They had longer duration of illness and they were more likely to receive antibiotics/antifungals. Only 22% of children with influenza received oseltamivir. Mortality was low (2.7%), however, pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) admission and death were correlated with virus detection. In our study mortality was low and PICU admission was related to virus identification. Further research is needed to clarify whether antibiotics in virus-proven infection are of value and underline the importance of oseltamivir\'s timely administration in influenza.","IncludeStatus":"Exclude","LisedInColA":"No Label","originalFormulation":"No Label","AloneOrComb":"No Label","cancerType":"No Label","studyType":"No Label","therapeuticAssociation":"No Label"},{"id":"768","Drug":"Oseltamivir","PMID":"17163386","Title":"Prevention and treatment of influenza in high-risk groups: children, pregnant women, immunocompromised hosts, and nursing home residents","Authors":"Whitley RJ, Monto AS.","Citation":"J Infect Dis. 2006 Nov 1;194 Suppl 2:S133-8. doi: 10.1086/507548.","CreatedDate":"12/14/06","Abstract":"The pediatric population experiences preventable hospitalizations and serves as a reservoir for influenza and its transmission to other children as well as adults. As a consequence, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices has recommended initiating influenza immunization of children as young as 6 months of age through 23 months of age and, recently, up to 5 years of age. However, immunization of older children has not yet become a priority of the US Public Health Service. As a consequence, the importance of antiviral agents, particularly neuraminidase (NA) inhibitors, cannot be overemphasized. From an epidemiological perspective, influenza resulted in higher childhood mortality than did Bordetella pertussis infection in 2003-2004. During that season, 153 children died of influenza, and two-thirds were <5 years of age. Importantly, nearly 50% of these children were previously healthy, with no underlying illness. Currently, 2 NA inhibitors are approved for the treatment of influenza in children. Zanamivir is approved for children >7 years of age, and oseltamivir is approved for children >1 year of age. Arguably, the younger children are at particular risk for influenza complications and hospitalization. In placebo-controlled studies in children >1 year of age, oseltamivir therapy accelerated resolution of clinical illness and defervescence and decreased both the incidence of otitis media and the concomitant use of antibiotics. However, oseltamivir is not currently approved for children <1 year of age. Three clinical toxicology studies identified neurotoxicity in newborn rats administered this medication. In these preclinical toxicology studies, the dose of oseltamivir exceeded that which would be used in humans. In addition, the metabolism of oseltamivir is different in rats than in humans. A key component of influenza therapy is the possibility for development of resistance. Although in studies performed in North America, resistance was not a frequent event, it has been documented in Japanese children treated with this medication; the adequacy of the dose used has been questioned. Children represent only one unique study population among others. Individuals who are at increased risk for influenza infection include the elderly, the immunocompromised, and pregnant women. Collectively, antiviral medications must be evaluated in populations in which they have not yet been assessed. The development of additional antiviral drugs is an important recommendation for the future, so that antiviral resistance can be circumvented. Similarly, availability of drugs for children <1 year of age is mandatory.","IncludeStatus":"Exclude","LisedInColA":"No Label","originalFormulation":"No Label","AloneOrComb":"No Label","cancerType":"No Label","studyType":"No Label","therapeuticAssociation":"No Label"},{"id":"769","Drug":"Oseltamivir","PMID":"25469231","Title":"Pandemic 2009 Influenza A (H1N1) virus infection in cancer and hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients; a multicenter observational study","Authors":"Dignani MC, Costantini P, Salgueira C, Jord\u221a\xb0n R, Guerrini G, Valledor A, Herrera F, Nenna A, Mora C, Roccia-Rossi I, Stecher D, Carbone E, Laborde A, Efron E, Altclas J, Calmaggi A, Cozzi J.","Citation":"Version 2.

The aim of our study was to retrospectively evaluate the clinical importance of OST-r variant in circulating strains of the pandemic H1N1pdm09 virus. By means of RT-PCR and Sanger sequencing we analysed the presence of OST-r variant in 76 H1N1pdm09 laboratory-confirmed cases, hospitalized at the hematologic/oncologic ward at Spedali Civili of Brescia -Italy. Out of 76 hospitalized hematologic/oncologic patients, 23 patients (30.2%) were infected by H1N1pdm09 virus.

However, post-HCT infections remain a concern for HCT recipients, particularly infections caused by community respiratory viruses (CRVs), which can lead to significant morbidity and mortality. These viruses can potentially cause lower respiratory tract illness, which is associated with a higher mortality rate among HCT recipients. Clinical management of CRV infections in HCT recipients includes supportive care and antiviral therapy, especially in high-risk individuals, when available. Directed antiviral therapy is only available for influenza infections, where successful use of neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir or zanamivir) and/or M2 inhibitors (amantadine or rimantadine) has been reported. Data on the successful use of ribavirin, with or without immunomodulators, for respiratory syncytial virus infections in HCT recipients has emerged over the past 2 decades but is still controversial at best because of a lack of randomized controlled trials. Because of the lack of directed antiviral therapy for most of these viruses, prevention should be emphasized for healthcare workers, patients, family, and friends and should include the promotion of the licensed inactivated influenza vaccine for HCT recipients, when indicated. In this review, we discuss the clinical management of respiratory viruses in this special patient population, focusing on commercially available antivirals, adjuvant therapy, and novel drugs under investigation, as well as on available means for prevention.","IncludeStatus":"Exclude","LisedInColA":"No Label","originalFormulation":"No Label","AloneOrComb":"No Label","cancerType":"No Label","studyType":"No Label","therapeuticAssociation":"No Label"},{"id":"774","Drug":"Oseltamivir","PMID":"20013322","Title":"Influenza A/pandemic 2009/H1N1 in the setting of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation: a potentially catastrophic problem in a vulnerable population","Authors":"Kharfan-Dabaja MA, Velez A, Richards K, Greene JN, Field T, Sandin R.","Citation":"Int J Hematol. 2010 Jan;91(1):124-7. doi: 10.1007/s12185-009-0464-5.

The goal of this study was to investigate the effectiveness and safety of various combinations of these drugs during their first 2 years of use in the real-world practice of French general hospitals. Data from patients treated with all-oral DAAs in 24 French non-academic hospital centers from March 1, 2014 to January 1, 2016, were prospectively recorded. The sustained virological response 12-24 weeks after treatment (SVR 12-24) was estimated and severe adverse events (SAE) were evaluated and their predictive factors were determined using logistic regression. Data from 1123 patients were analyzed. The population was 69% genotype (G) 1, 13% G3, 11.5% G4, 5% G2, 49% with cirrhosis and 55% treatment-experienced. The treatment regimens were sofosbuvir/ledipasvir (38%), sofosbuvir/daclatasvir (32%), sofosbuvir/simeprevir (17%), ombitasvir+paritaprevir+ritonavir (5%) (with dasabuvir 3.5%), and sofosbuvir/ribavirin (8%). Ribavirin was given to 24% of patients. The SVR 12-24 was 91.0% (95% CI: 89.2-92.5%). Sofosbuvir-ribavirin was less effective than other regimens. The independent predictors of SVR 12-24 by logistic regression were body weight, albumin, previous hepatocellular carcinoma and treatment regimen (sofosbuvir/ribavirin vs. others). Sixty-four severe adverse events (SAE) were observed in 59 [5.6%] patients, and were independently predicted by cirrhosis and baseline hemoglobin. Serum creatinine increased during treatment (mean 8.5%, [P<10<sup>-5</sup>]), satisfying criteria for acute kidney injury in 62 patients (7.3%). Patient-reported overall tolerance was excellent, and patient-reported fatigue decreased during and after treatment. Second generation DAAs combinations are as effective and well tolerated in a \xab\xa0real-world\xa0\xbb population as in clinical trials.

Data from HCV genotype 1 patients treated with either OMV/PTV/r+DSV\xb1ribavirin (RBV) (n=1567) or LDV/SOF\xb1RBV (n=1758) in 35 centers across Spain between April 1, 2015 and February 28, 2016 were recorded in a large national database. Demographic, clinical and virological data were analyzed. Details of serious adverse events (SAEs) were recorded. The two cohorts were not matched with respect to baseline characteristics and could not be compared directly. The SVR12 rate was 96.8% with OMV/PTVr/DSV\xb1RBV and 95.8% with LDV/SOF\xb1RBV. No significant differences were observed in SVR according to HCV subgenotype (p=0.321 [OMV/PTV/r+DSV\xb1RBV] and p=0.174 [LDV/SOF]) or degree of fibrosis (c0.548 [OMV/PTV/r/DSV\xb1RBV] and p=0.085 [LDV/SOF]). Only baseline albumin level was significantly associated with failure to achieve SVR (p<0.05) on multivariate analysis. Rates of SAEs and SAE-associated treatment discontinuation were 5.4% and 1.7%, in the OMV/PTV/r+DSV subcohort and 5.5% and 1.5% in the LDV/SOF subcohort, respectively. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) recurred in 30% of patients with a complete response to therapy for previous HCC. Incident HCC was reported in 0.93%. In this large cohort of patients managed in the real-world setting in Spain, OMV/PTV/r+DSV and LDV/SOF achieved high rates of SVR12, comparable to those observed in randomized controlled trials, with similarly good safety profiles. In clinical trials, second-generation direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs) have been shown to cure over 90% of patients chronically infected with the genotype 1 hepatitis C virus and have been better tolerated than previous treatment regimens. However, patients enrolled in clinical trials do not reflect the real patient population encountered in routine practice. The current study, which includes almost 4,000 patients, demonstrates comparable rates of cure with two increasingly used DAA combinations as those observed in the clinical trial environment, confirming that clinical trial findings with DAAs translate into the real-world setting, where patient populations are more diverse and complex.","IncludeStatus":"Include","LisedInColA":"Yes","originalFormulation":"Yes","AloneOrComb":"Combination","cancerType":"Liver","studyType":"Clinical observational","therapeuticAssociation":"Inconclusive"},{"id":"785","Drug":"Ritonavir ","PMID":"25644279","Title":"Randomized trial of interferon- and ribavirin-free ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir in treatment-experienced hepatitis C virus-infected patients","Authors":"Chayama K, Notsumata K, Kurosaki M, Sato K, Rodrigues L Jr, Setze C, Badri P, Pilot-Matias T, Vilchez RA, Kumada H.","Citation":"Hepatology. 2015 May;61(5):1523-32. doi: 10.1002/hep.27705.

Although HCV genotype 4 constitutes about 20% of HCV infections worldwide, the prevalence in Egypt is more than 90%. We assessed the efficacy and safety of the two direct-acting antiviral drugs ombitasvir, an NS5A inhibitor, and paritaprevir, an NS3/4A protease inhibitor dosed with ritonavir, plus ribavirin in treatment of chronic HCV infection in Egypt. AGATE-II was a phase 3, open-label, partly randomised trial in patients with chronic HCV genotype 4 infection recruited from five academic and hepatology centres in Egypt. Patients were HCV treatment-naive or treatment-experienced with interferon-based regimens. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older, and had been chronically infected with HCV genotype 4 for at least 6 months with a plasma HCV RNA concentration of more than 1000 IU/mL at screening. Patients without cirrhosis were assigned to receive 12 weeks of 25 mg ombitasvir, 150 mg paritaprevir, and 100 mg ritonavir orally once daily plus weight-based ribavirin. Patients with compensated cirrhosis were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive the same treatment for either 12 weeks or 24 weeks. Randomisation was stratified by previous pegylated interferon and ribavirin treatment experience using a web-based interactive response technology system and computer-generated schedules prepared by personnel from the funder\'s statistics department. Investigators were masked to randomisation schedules and were informed of each patient\'s assigned treatment by the interactive response technology system immediately after allocation. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with a sustained virological response (HCV RNA <15 IU/mL) 12 weeks after the last dose of study drug (SVR12). All patients who received at least one dose of study drugs were included in the primary and safety analysis. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02247401. Between Nov 4, 2014, and March 16, 2015, we screened 182 patients with HCV infection, of whom 160 were eligible for inclusion; 100 patients were assessed as not having cirrhosis and were given 12 weeks of treatment, and 60 patients assessed as having cirrhosis were randomly assigned to the 12-week treatment group (n=31) or the 24-week treatment group (n=29). 94 (94%; 95% CI 88-97) of 100 patients in the without cirrhosis group, 30 (97%; 84-99) of 31 patients in the cirrhosis 12-week treatment group, and 27 (93%; 78-98) of 29 patients in the cirrhosis 24-week treatment group achieved SVR12. The most common adverse events in patients without cirrhosis were headache (41 [41%]) and fatigue (35 [35%]). Fatigue occurred in nine (29%) patients in the cirrhosis 12-week treatment group and 11 (38%) patients in the cirrhosis 24-week treatment group, and headache occurred in nine (29%) patients in the cirrhosis 12-week treatment group and in 10 (35%) patients in the cirrhosis 24-week treatment group. Adverse events were predominantly mild or moderate in severity, and laboratory abnormalities were not clinically meaningful. No patients discontinued treatment because of an adverse event. One serious adverse event in the group without cirrhosis was attributed to study drugs by the investigators; the patient had deep venous thrombosis. Ombitasvir, paritaprevir, and ritonavir plus ribavirin for 12 weeks achieved SVR12 in a high proportion of patients and was well tolerated in Egyptian patients with HCV genotype 4 infection with or without compensated cirrhosis. Extension of treatment to 24 weeks in patients with cirrhosis did not improve the proportion of patients achieving SVR12. A shorter duration regimen could be useful to address the significant burden of HCV genotype 4 infection in patients with compensated cirrhosis.

It is associated with serious complication of Cirrhosis and Hepatocellular carcinoma leading to significant morbidity and mortality. Until now the only treatment option for this serious disease was interferon based therapy which had poor tolerance and at best SVR (Sustained virological response) in only 50% of cases. With the introduction of other direct - acting antiviral agents the treatment of HCV has been revolutionized with significantly high rates of cure. Among novel Direct acting antivirals are non-nucleoside inhibitor NS5B which is highly effective in treatment of HCV genotype 1 a and 1b including those with compensated cirrhosis achieving high cure rates with SVR more than 97 % in pooled analysis from six different phase 3 trials. This review will discuss the DAA - Dasabuvir, a non - nucleoside NS5B inhibitor, its mechanism of action, efficacy, safety & tolerance, and drug resistance. Dasabuvir is approved by FDA in combination with other DAA agents called as the 3D(Viekira Pak) in various interferon free regimens achieving high cure rates (SVR >95%) with low adverse effects. In Europe, it is approved by European medicines agency for use in combination with Ombitasvir, Paritaprevir, and ritonavir with or without ribavirin. The drug is used in treatment naive as well as previously treated patient with high success rates. It is also approved in patients with compensated cirrhosis, patients with HIV co-infection and liver transplant recipients which were in the past were excluded from treatment with interferon based therapy. Dasabuvir is extensively evaluated in large clinical trials and shown excellent SVR among HCV genotype1 patient population in combination with other oral DAAs, with good safety profile and tolerance. Its drawback is its genotype restriction, need for ribavirin (RBV) for 1a genotype, low resistance barrier and high cost. It is well tolerated with less than 1 % of patients permanently discontinuing treatment and 2% of patient experiencing a serious adverse reaction. It is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to ritonavir (e.g. Steven - Johnson syndrome) and strong inducers of CYP3A and CYP2CB.

Although these agents have been designed to selectively bind to the catalytic site of HIV protease, evidence indicates that other cellular and microbial enzymes and pathways are also affected. It has been reported that patients treated with highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) containing a protease inhibitor may be at reduced risk of Kaposi\'s sarcoma (KS) and some types of non-Hodgkin lymphomas; some disease regressions have also been described. Here we review recent data showing that several widely used protease inhibitors, including indinavir, saquinavir, ritonavir, and nelfinavir, can affect important cellular and tissue processes such as angiogenesis, tumour growth and invasion, inflammation, antigen processing and presentation, cell survival, and tissue remodelling. Most of these non-HIV-related effects of protease inhibitors are due to inhibition of cell invasion and matrix metalloprotease activity, or modulation of the cell proteasome and NFkappaB. These elements are required for development of most tumours. Thus, by direct and indirect activities, protease inhibitors can simultaneously block several pathways involved in tumour growth, invasion, and metastasis. These findings indicate that protease inhibitors can be exploited for the therapy of KS and other tumours that occur in both HIV-infected and non-infected individuals. A multicentre phase II clinical trial with indinavir in non-HIV-associated KS is about to start in Italy.","IncludeStatus":"Exclude","LisedInColA":"No Label","originalFormulation":"No Label","AloneOrComb":"No Label","cancerType":"No Label","studyType":"No Label","therapeuticAssociation":"No Label"},{"id":"795","Drug":"Ritonavir ","PMID":"11363956","Title":"Piloting the meanders of AIDS research","Authors":"Mascolini M.","Citation":"J Int Assoc Physicians AIDS Care. 1996 Dec;2(12):9-27.","CreatedDate":"12/1/96","Abstract":"At the 36th International Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy (ICAAC), updates on research on non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, protease inhibitors, and newer treatments were presented.

Patients were switched to DRV/r 800/100\u2009mg once daily, either as monotherapy or with two NRTIs. In all, 221 patients were measured for 25-hydroxyvitamin D at a central laboratory before randomized treatment started and at week 96. Multiple regression was used to correlate vitamin D levels with gender, season, ethnic group, treatment group, and use of antiretrovirals. Overall, 80% of patients were male and 91% were white, with a mean age of 44 years. At screening, 170/221 (77%) patients had vitamin D deficiency (<50\u2009nmol/liter).

At screening, lower vitamin D levels were associated with season, race, and use of efavirenz and/or zidovudine. Switching from efavirenz and/or zidovudine to darunavir/ritonavir during the trial led to increases in vitamin D levels. Routine screening of HIV-positive patients for vitamin D should be considered and the optimal management further defined.","IncludeStatus":"Exclude","LisedInColA":"No Label","originalFormulation":"No Label","AloneOrComb":"No Label","cancerType":"No Label","studyType":"No Label","therapeuticAssociation":"No Label"},{"id":"798","Drug":"Ritonavir ","PMID":"9875577","Title":"Protease inhibitor and triple-drug therapy: cellular immune parameters are not restored in pediatric AIDS patients after 6 months of treatment","Authors":"Chougnet C, Fowke KR, Mueller BU, Smith S, Zuckerman J, Jankelevitch S, Steinberg SM, Luban N, Pizzo PA, Shearer GM.","Citation":"AIDS. 1998 Dec 24;12(18):2397-406. doi: 10.1097/00002030-199818000-00008.","CreatedDate":"1/6/99","Abstract":"To assess whether treatment of HIV-positive children by antiretroviral drugs for a 6-month period would improve immune function significantly.

Immunological parameters were assessed in vitro at four time points (at enrollment, at weeks 2-4, at weeks 12-16, and at weeks 24-28). Assessments included: cytokine production by monocytes, T-cell proliferation to mitogen or recall antigens (including an HIV antigen) and apoptotic cell death. Plasma levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and soluble TNF receptor (sTNF-R) were also measured, in addition to CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts and viral load. In addition, limited analyses were performed on samples from 17 children after 120 weeks of therapy, including 104 weeks of triple therapy. At enrollment, the 89 children exhibited severe immune defects. Antiretroviral therapy raised CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts significantly and decreased viral loads. In contrast, the in vitro immune parameters studied were not improved, except for plasma levels of sTNF-RII which decreased in parallel with the decrease in viral load. In addition, there was a trend towards increased skin test reactivity for the ritonavir-treated children. No differences were seen in the immune parameters whether the patients were treated with mono- or triple therapy. Results obtained after 120 weeks of therapy demonstrated that defective interleukin-12 production was not restored by long-term therapy. After 6 months of therapy, with the exception of decreased sTNF-RII levels, and a trend towards increased skin test reactivity, restoration of several defective cellular immune responses did not occur despite significantly decreased viral loads and increased CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts.","IncludeStatus":"Exclude","LisedInColA":"No Label","originalFormulation":"No Label","AloneOrComb":"No Label","cancerType":"No Label","studyType":"No Label","therapeuticAssociation":"No Label"},{"id":"799","Drug":"Ritonavir ","PMID":"32245397","Title":"Ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir & dasabuvir \xac\xb1 ribavirin following protease inhibitors failure - a prospective multi-centre trial","Authors":"Deutsch L, Houri I, Ben-Ari Z, Shlomai A, Veitsman E, Cohen-Ezra O, Issachar A, Mor O, Gozlan Y, Bruck R, Menachem Y, Zelber-Sagi S, Katchman H, Shibolet O.","Citation":"BMC Infect Dis. 2020 Apr 3;20(1):264. doi: 10.1186/s12879-020-4921-3.","CreatedDate":"4/5/20","Abstract":"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a leading cause of chronic liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma.

Serum C-reactive protein (CRP) is an acute phase protein induced mainly by IL-6 in response to inflammatory conditions, particularly infection. The biological functions of CRP include opsonisation, induction of phagocytosis, complement activation, or chemotaxis enhancement. Factors interfering with IL-6-mediated recruitment of innate immune responses, such as the presence of anti-IL6 antibodies, may therefore compromise the host resistance to microbial pathogens. This has major implications for the use of IL-6-targeting biologics, such as tocilizumab or sarilumab in rheumatologic, immune dysregulation diseases, and cancer. <b>Case presentation:</b> 20-month-old Czech female developed severe septic shock with clinical and laboratory signs of systemic inflammation but no increase of CRP or IL-6. The offending pathogen was most likely <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>, detected in a throat swab; the response to antibiotic treatment was prompt. A defect in the integrity of IL-6/CRP axis was suspected and verified by the detection of neutralizing IL-6 antibodies in the serum of the child. <b>Conclusion:</b> We report a first case of systemic bacterial infection in a patient with anti-IL6 autoantibodies. Disturbed IL-6 signaling, whether iatrogenic by targeted IL-6 blockade or endogenous due to the presence of autoantibodies against IL-6, represents a risk factor for increased infectious susceptibility. Patients with severe bacterial infection without elevation of CRP should be examined for the presence of anti-IL6 autoantibodies.","IncludeStatus":"Exclude","LisedInColA":"No Label","originalFormulation":"No Label","AloneOrComb":"No Label","cancerType":"No Label","studyType":"No Label","therapeuticAssociation":"No Label"},{"id":"803","Drug":"Tocilizumab","PMID":"27913530","Title":"Cytokine release syndrome with novel therapeutics for acute lymphoblastic leukemia","Authors":"Frey NV, Porter DL.","Citation":"Hematology Am Soc Hematol Educ Program. 2016 Dec 2;2016(1):567-572. doi: 10.1182/asheducation-2016.1.567.","CreatedDate":"12/4/16","Abstract":"T-cell-engaging immunotherapies are exciting new approaches to treat patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).

Incidence rates (95% CIs) for tofacitinib 5 and 10 mg twice daily (BID) in phase 3 trials were 3.02 (2.25, 4.05) and 3.00 (2.24, 4.02), respectively. Corresponding incidence rates in long-term extension studies were 2.50 (2.05, 3.04) and 3.19 (2.74, 3.72). The risk ratios (95% CIs) versus placebo for tofacitinib 5 and 10 mg BID were 2.21 (0.60, 8.14) and 2.02 (0.56, 7.28), respectively. Risk differences (95% CIs) versus placebo for tofacitinib 5 and 10 mg BID were 0.38% (-0.24%, 0.99%) and 0.40% (-0.22%, 1.02%), respectively. In interventional studies, the risk of serious infections with tofacitinib is comparable to published rates for biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs in patients with moderate to severely active RA.","IncludeStatus":"Exclude","LisedInColA":"No Label","originalFormulation":"No Label","AloneOrComb":"No Label","cancerType":"No Label","studyType":"No Label","therapeuticAssociation":"No Label"},{"id":"806","Drug":"Tocilizumab","PMID":"28544595","Title":"Severe cytokine release syndrome in a patient receiving PD-1-directed therapy","Authors":"Rotz SJ, Leino D, Szabo S, Mangino JL, Turpin BK, Pressey JG.","Citation":"Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2017 Dec;64(12). doi: 10.1002/pbc.26642.

This syndrome is a systemic immune storm that involves the mass cytokines releasing by activated immune cells. This phenomenon causes multisystem damages and sometimes even death. In this study, we reported the management of a patient with recurrent and refractory multiple myeloma and three patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia who suffered CRS during CAR-T treatment. The early application of tocilizumab, an anti-IL-6 receptor antibody, according to toxicity grading and clinical manifestation is recommended especially for patients who suffer continuous hyperpyrexia, hypotensive shock, acute respiratory failure, and whose CRS toxicities deteriorated rapidly. Moreover, low doses of dexamethasone (5-10 mg/day) were used for refractory CRS not responding to tocilizumab. The effective management of the toxicities associated with CRS will bring additional survival opportunities and improve the quality of life for patients with cancer.","IncludeStatus":"Exclude","LisedInColA":"No Label","originalFormulation":"No Label","AloneOrComb":"No Label","cancerType":"No Label","studyType":"No Label","therapeuticAssociation":"No Label"},{"id":"809","Drug":"Tocilizumab","PMID":"28433474","Title":"Beneficial effect of tocilizumab in myasthenia gravis refractory to rituximab","Authors":"Jonsson DI, Pirskanen R, Piehl F.","Citation":"Neuromuscul Disord. 2017 Jun;27(6):565-568. doi: 10.1016/j.nmd.2017.03.007.

We report four cases and an updated literature review on the TCZ efficacy and safety in patients with TA. Patients with TA defined by ACR 1990 criteria were included. Clinical, biological and imaging data were retrospectively reported. Disease activity was analyzed before TCZ and during the follow-up. Medline database was searched for systematic literature review. One hundred and five patients (median age 28years [22-38]) were included, mostly refractory cases (76 patients, 72%). Median TCZ duration was 12months [6-20]. Among 105 patients, 90 patients (85.7%) had an initial clinical response within three months [3-6] and 43/66 patients (65.2%) had a radiological improvement. Only seven patients (9%) showed relapse on therapy. Corticosteroid dose reduction was obtained in 75/83 patients (90.4%). Relapse after TCZ discontinuation was observed in six patients (46%), with a median time of five months [2-9]. Twenty-four side-effects were noted in 18 patients (18%), with TCZ interruption in seven cases (7%): 10 infections, five cytopenia, six hepatitis, one pancreatitis, one cutaneous rash and one breast cancer.

Our systematic review, standard meta-analysis and network meta-analysis (NMA) updates the 2009 Cochrane overview, \'Biologics for rheumatoid arthritis (RA)\' and adds new data. This review is focused on biologic or tofacitinib therapy in people with RA who had previously been treated unsuccessfully with biologics. To compare the benefits and harms of biologics (abatacept, adalimumab, anakinra, certolizumab pegol, etanercept, golimumab, infliximab, rituximab, tocilizumab) and small molecule tofacitinib versus comparator (placebo or methotrexate (MTX)/other DMARDs) in people with RA, previously unsuccessfully treated with biologics. On 22 June 2015 we searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase; and trials registries (WHO trials register, Clinicaltrials.gov). We carried out article selection, data extraction, and risk of bias and GRADE assessments in duplicate. We calculated direct estimates with 95% confidence intervals (CI) using standard meta-analysis. We used a Bayesian mixed treatment comparison (MTC) approach for NMA estimates with 95% credible intervals (CrI). We converted odds ratios (OR) to risk ratios (RR) for ease of understanding. We have also presented results in absolute measures as risk difference (RD) and number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB). Outcomes measured included four benefits (ACR50, function measured by Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) score, remission defined as DAS < 1.6 or DAS28 < 2.6, slowing of radiographic progression) and three harms (withdrawals due to adverse events, serious adverse events, and cancer). This update includes nine new RCTs for a total of 12 RCTs that included 3364 participants. The comparator was placebo only in three RCTs (548 participants), MTX or other traditional DMARD in six RCTs (2468 participants), and another biologic in three RCTs (348 participants). Data were available for four tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-biologics: (certolizumab pegol (1 study; 37 participants), etanercept (3 studies; 348 participants), golimumab (1 study; 461 participants), infliximab (1 study; 27 participants)), three non-TNF biologics (abatacept (3 studies; 632 participants), rituximab (2 studies; 1019 participants), and tocilizumab (2 studies; 589 participants)); there was only one study for tofacitinib (399 participants). The majority of the trials (10/12) lasted less than 12 months.We judged 33% of the studies at low risk of bias for allocation sequence generation, allocation concealment and blinding, 25% had low risk of bias for attrition, 92% were at unclear risk for selective reporting; and 92% had low risk of bias for major baseline imbalance. We downgraded the quality of the evidence for most outcomes to moderate or low due to study limitations, heterogeneity, or rarity of direct comparator trials. Biologic monotherapy versus placeboCompared to placebo, biologics were associated with clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvement in RA as demonstrated by higher ACR50 and RA remission rates. RR was 4.10 for ACR50 (95% CI 1.97 to 8.55; moderate-quality evidence); absolute benefit RD 14% (95% CI 6% to 21%); and NNTB = 8 (95% CI 4 to 23). RR for RA remission was 13.51 (95% CI 1.85 to 98.45, one study available; moderate-quality evidence); absolute benefit RD 9% (95% CI 5% to 13%); and NNTB = 11 (95% CI 3 to 136). Results for withdrawals due to adverse events and serious adverse events did not show any statistically significant or clinically meaningful differences. There were no studies available for analysis for function measured by HAQ, radiographic progression, or cancer outcomes. There were not enough data for any of the outcomes to look at subgroups. Biologic + MTX versus active comparator (MTX/other traditional DMARDs)Compared to MTX/other traditional DMARDs, biologic + MTX was associated with a clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvement in ACR50, function measured by HAQ, and RA remission rates in direct comparisons. RR for ACR50 was 4.07 (95% CI 2.76 to 5.99; high-quality evidence); absolute benefit RD 16% (10% to 21%); NNTB = 7 (95% CI 5 to 11). HAQ scores showed an improvement with a mean difference (MD) of 0.29 (95% CI 0.21 to 0.36; high-quality evidence); absolute benefit RD 9.7% improvement (95% CI 7% to 12%); and NNTB = 5 (95% CI 4 to 7). Remission rates showed an improved RR of 20.73 (95% CI 4.13 to 104.16; moderate-quality evidence); absolute benefit RD 10% (95% CI 8% to 13%); and NNTB = 17 (95% CI 4 to 96), among the biologic + MTX group compared to MTX/other DMARDs. There were no studies for radiographic progression. Results were not clinically meaningful or statistically significantly different for withdrawals due to adverse events or serious adverse events, and were inconclusive for cancer. Tofacitinib monotherapy versus placeboThere were no published data. Tofacitinib + MTX versus active comparator (MTX)In one study, compared to MTX, tofacitinib + MTX was associated with a clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvement in ACR50 (RR 3.24; 95% CI 1.78 to 5.89; absolute benefit RD 19% (95% CI 12% to 26%); NNTB = 6 (95% CI 3 to 14); moderate-quality evidence), and function measured by HAQ, MD 0.27 improvement (95% CI 0.14 to 0.39); absolute benefit RD 9% (95% CI 4.7% to 13%), NNTB = 5 (95% CI 4 to 10); high-quality evidence). RA remission rates were not statistically significantly different but the observed difference may be clinically meaningful (RR 15.44 (95% CI 0.93 to 256.1; high-quality evidence); absolute benefit RD 6% (95% CI 3% to 9%); NNTB could not be calculated. There were no studies for radiographic progression. There were no statistically significant or clinically meaningful differences for withdrawals due to adverse events and serious adverse events, and results were inconclusive for cancer. Biologic (with or without MTX) or tofacitinib (with MTX) use was associated with clinically meaningful and statistically significant benefits (ACR50, HAQ, remission) compared to placebo or an active comparator (MTX/other traditional DMARDs) among people with RA previously unsuccessfully treated with biologics.No studies examined radiographic progression.

RA patients with previous inadequate response to anti-TNF\u03b1 therapy (n=299) were randomly assigned to tocilizumab 4 or 8 mg/kg with methotrexate (10-25 mg weekly) or placebo with methotrexate. Type III collagen degradation (C3M) and CRP degradation (CRPM) were analysed in serum samples at baseline and 16 weeks. Treatment with 4 and 8 mg/kg tocilizumab significantly decreased C3M (p=0.0001 and p=0.0007) and CRPM (p<0.0001) levels after 16 weeks. Changes in C3M and CRPM levels after 16 weeks correlated well with the changes in disease activity score 28 (DAS28).

Its effect on a panel of cytokines and growth factors was evaluated. Three patients, fulfilling the PMR ACR/EULAR criteria, received TCZ at the dosage of 8\xa0mg/kg every 4 weeks for three times followed by prednisone 0.2\xa0mg/kg in case of inefficacy. Concentrations of IL-10, IL-6, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-10, IL-17, interferon (IFN)-\u03b3, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), and leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) were measured at baseline, after 72\xa0h of the first TCZ infusion and then at weeks 1, 4, 5, 8, 9, 12, 13, 14, 16, and 22. A slight clinical improvement was seen only after the first TCZ infusion, but was largely inferior to that of conventional doses of GC administered subsequently. An ischaemic visual accident suggestive of GCA occurred in one patient during TCZ treatment. IL-6 was increased at baseline compared to controls, further increased after the first TCZ infusion, and was suppressed by GC. IL-17 production decreased during TCZ treatment and reverted to pre-treatment levels after GC. VEGF e PDGF showed a less constant pattern, but an increase of VEGF concentration antedated visual symptoms. The other cytokines were not detectable in patients and controls. In our small sample, TCZ was not able to suppress inflammation at the same degree as GC. As a result, monotherapy with TCZ in PMR cannot be recommended, although its efficacy as adjunctive treatment in GC-resistant patients should be further evaluated.","IncludeStatus":"Exclude","LisedInColA":"No Label","originalFormulation":"No Label","AloneOrComb":"No Label","cancerType":"No Label","studyType":"No Label","therapeuticAssociation":"No Label"},{"id":"816","Drug":"Tocilizumab","PMID":"27913894","Title":"Use and effectiveness of tocilizumab among patients with rheumatoid arthritis: an observational study from the British Society for Rheumatology Biologics Register for rheumatoid arthritis","Authors":"Kihara M, Davies R, Kearsley-Fleet L, Watson KD, Lunt M, Symmons DP, Hyrich KL; British Society for Rheumatology Biologics Register.","Citation":"Clin Rheumatol. 2017 Feb;36(2):241-250. doi: 10.1007/s10067-016-3485-5.

The treatment response at 6\xa0months was similar between subsequent-line TCZ users and first-line users after adjusting for baseline patient differences. Concurrent MTX use was not associated with treatment response in either first- or subsequent-line TCZ users. TCZ has been primarily used as subsequent-line biologic in the UK.

This review is focused on biologic monotherapy in people with RA in whom treatment with traditional disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) including methotrexate (MTX) had failed (MTX/other DMARD-experienced). To assess the benefits and harms of biologic monotherapy (includes anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) (adalimumab, certolizumab pegol, etanercept, golimumab, infliximab) or non-TNF (abatacept, anakinra, rituximab, tocilizumab)) or tofacitinib monotherapy (oral small molecule) versus comparator (placebo or MTX/other DMARDs) in adults with RA who were MTX/other DMARD-experienced. We searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; The Cochrane Library 2015, Issue 6, June), MEDLINE (via OVID 1946 to June 2015), and Embase (via OVID 1947 to June 2015). Article selection, data extraction and risk of bias and GRADE assessments were done in duplicate. We calculated direct estimates with 95% confidence intervals (CI) using standard meta-analysis. We used a Bayesian mixed treatment comparisons (MTC) approach for NMA estimates with 95% credible intervals (CrI). We converted odds ratios (OR) to risk ratios (RR) for ease of understanding. We calculated absolute measures as risk difference (RD) and number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB). This update includes 40 new RCTs for a total of 46 RCTs, of which 41 studies with 14,049 participants provided data. The comparator was placebo in 16 RCTs (4,532 patients), MTX or other DMARD in 13 RCTs (5,602 patients), and another biologic in 12 RCTs (3,915 patients). Monotherapy versus placeboBased on moderate-quality direct evidence, biologic monotherapy (without concurrent MTX/other DMARDs) was associated with a clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvement in American College of Rheumatology score (ACR50) and physical function, as measured by the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) versus placebo. RR was 4.68 for ACR50 (95% CI, 2.93 to 7.48); absolute benefit RD 23% (95% CI, 18% to 29%); and NNTB = 5 (95% CI, 3 to 8). The mean difference (MD) was -0.32 for HAQ (95% CI, -0.42 to -0.23; a negative sign represents greater HAQ improvement); absolute benefit of -10.7% (95% CI, -14% to -7.7%); and NNTB = 4 (95% CI, 3 to 5). Direct and NMA estimates for TNF biologic, non-TNF biologic or tofacitinib monotherapy showed similar results for ACR50 , downgraded to moderate-quality evidence. Direct and NMA estimates for TNF biologic, anakinra or tofacitinib monotherapy showed a similar results for HAQ versus placebo with mostly moderate quality evidence.Based on moderate-quality direct evidence, biologic monotherapy was associated with a clinically meaningful and statistically significant greater proportion of disease remission versus placebo with RR 1.12 (95% CI 1.03 to 1.22); absolute benefit 10% (95% CI, 3% to 17%; NNTB = 10 (95% CI, 8 to 21)).Based on low-quality direct evidence, results for biologic monotherapy for withdrawals due to adverse events and serious adverse events were inconclusive, with wide confidence intervals encompassing the null effect and evidence of an important increase. The direct estimate for TNF monotherapy for withdrawals due to adverse events showed a clinically meaningful and statistically significant result with RR 2.02 (95% CI, 1.08 to 3.78), absolute benefit RD 3% (95% CI,1% to 4%), based on moderate-quality evidence. The NMA estimates for TNF biologic, non-TNF biologic, anakinra, or tofacitinib monotherapy for withdrawals due to adverse events and for serious adverse events were all inconclusive and downgraded to low-quality evidence. Monotherapy versus active comparator (MTX/other DMARDs)Based on direct evidence of moderate quality, biologic monotherapy (without concurrent MTX/other DMARDs) was associated with a clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvement in ACR50 and HAQ scores versus MTX/other DMARDs with a RR of 1.54 (95% CI, 1.14 to 2.08); absolute benefit 13% (95% CI, 2% to 23%), NNTB = 7 (95% CI, 4 to 26) and a mean difference in HAQ of -0.27 (95% CI, -0.40 to -0.14); absolute benefit of -9% (95% CI, -13.3% to -4.7%), NNTB = 2 (95% CI, 2 to 4). Direct and NMA estimates for TNF monotherapy and NMA estimate for non-TNF biologic monotherapy for ACR50 showed similar results, based on moderate-quality evidence. Direct and NMA estimates for non-TNF biologic monotherapy, but not TNF monotherapy, showed similar HAQ improvements , based on mostly moderate-quality evidence.There were no statistically significant or clinically meaningful differences for direct estimates of biologic monotherapy versus active comparator for RA disease remission. NMA estimates showed a statistically significant and clinically meaningful difference versus active comparator for TNF monotherapy (absolute improvement 7% (95% CI, 2% to 14%)) and non-TNF monotherapy (absolute improvement 19% (95% CrI, 7% to 36%)), both downgraded to moderate quality.Based on moderate-quality direct evidence from a single study, radiographic progression (scale 0 to 448) was statistically significantly reduced in those on biologic monotherapy versus active comparator, MD -4.34 (95% CI, -7.56 to -1.12), though the absolute reduction was small, -0.97% (95% CI, -1.69% to -0.25%). We are not sure of the clinical relevance of this reduction.Direct and NMA evidence (downgraded to low quality), showed inconclusive results for withdrawals due to adverse events, serious adverse events and cancer, with wide confidence intervals encompassing the null effect and evidence of an important increase. Based mostly on RCTs of six to 12-month duration in people with RA who had previously experienced and failed treatment with MTX/other DMARDs, biologic monotherapy improved ACR50, function and RA remission rates compared to placebo or MTX/other DMARDs.Radiographic progression was reduced versus active comparator, although the clinical significance was unclear.Results were inconclusive for whether biologic monotherapy was associated with an increased risk of withdrawals due to adverse events, serious adverse events or cancer, versus placebo (no data on cancer) or MTX/other DMARDs.","IncludeStatus":"Exclude","LisedInColA":"No Label","originalFormulation":"No Label","AloneOrComb":"No Label","cancerType":"No Label","studyType":"No Label","therapeuticAssociation":"No Label"},{"id":"818","Drug":"Tocilizumab","PMID":"26666616","Title":"Tocilizumab for AA Amyloidosis after Treatment of Multicentric Castleman Disease with Steroids, Chemotherapy and Rituximab for Over 20 Years","Authors":"Iijima T, Hoshino J, Suwabe T, Sumida K, Mise K, Kawada M, Ueno T, Hamanoue S, Hayami N, Hiramatsu R, Sawa N, Takaichi K, Ubara Y.","Citation":"Intern Med. 2015;54(24):3215-9. doi: 10.2169/internalmedicine.54.4183.

Rituximab was started, but Cre increased to 2.6 mg/dL in 2010 and UP was unchanged. Therefore, treatment with tocilizmab was started. As a result, his hypergammaglobulinemia was well controlled, C-reactive protein became normal, UP decreased to 3.5 g daily, and Cre remained at 2.5 mg/dL in 2013.

A unique clinicopathologic variant of multicentric Castleman\'s disease, TAFRO (i.e., thrombocytopenia, anasarca, fever, renal failure or reticulin fibrosis, and organomegaly) syndrome, was recently proposed in Japan. Despite the successful use of anti-interleukin-6 therapy in some patients with TAFRO syndrome, not all patients achieve remission. The pathophysiological etiology of and suitable therapeutic strategies for this variant have not been established. Here, we present our experience of a unique case of TAFRO syndrome in a 78-year-old woman whose symptoms responded differently to several therapies. Tocilizumab, an anti-interleukin-6 receptor antibody, successfully induced remission of fever and lymphadenopathy. However, severe thrombocytopenia persisted and she developed anasarca, ascites, and pleural effusion shortly thereafter. Rituximab, an anti-CD20 antibody, and glucocorticoid therapy provided no symptom relief. In contrast, cyclosporine A, an immunosuppressive agent that blocks T cell function by inhibiting interleukin-2, yielded immediate improvements in systemic fluid retention and a gradual increase in platelet count, with complete resolution of disease symptoms. Excessive serum interleukin-2, when used as an anti-cancer agent, has been reported to cause side effects such as fluid retention, thrombocytopenia, and renal failure. Our case was unique because the anti-interleukin-2 therapy successfully improved symptoms that were not relieved with anti-interleukin-6 therapy. The present report therefore provides insight into the possible role of interleukin-2, in addition to interleukin-6, in TAFRO syndrome. This report will certainly help to clarify the pathogenesis of and optimal treatment strategies for TAFRO syndrome.

The two large phase 2/3 randomized placebo-controlled trials of B-cell depletion, using anti-CD20 antibody, rituximab, in SLE, reported unexpected negative results. On the contrary, two large phase 3 trials of belimumab, the monoclonal antibody against B-lymphocyte stimulator (BLyS), showed significant clinical benefit. Response rates were 57.6 and 43.2% for 10 mg/kg belimumab, compared with 43.6 and 33.8% for placebo in BLISS-52 and BLISS-76, respectively. Studies of a co-stimulation blocker (abatacept), tumor necrosis factor inhibitor (infliximab), and interleukin-6 inhibitor (tocilizumab) were either negative (abatacept) or were associated with high rates of adverse events. Studies of T cell and interferon inhibition remain in the early development phase. Despite the enthusiasm in the field of biologic therapies, the majority of these new modalities have fallen short of expectations for various reasons. Only belimumab has recently met its primary outcome in two phase 3 trials.","IncludeStatus":"Exclude","LisedInColA":"No Label","originalFormulation":"No Label","AloneOrComb":"No Label","cancerType":"No Label","studyType":"No Label","therapeuticAssociation":"No Label"},{"id":"827","Drug":"Tocilizumab","PMID":"22284606","Title":"Efficacy of tocilizumab in refractory giant cell arteritis","Authors":"Vinit J, Bielefeld P, Muller G, Besancenot JF.","Citation":"Joint Bone Spine. 2012 May;79(3):317-8. doi: 10.1016/j.jbspin.2011.11.008.

We here report the first Caucasian patient with aquaporin 4 (AQP4) antibody (NMO-IgG)-seropositive NMO presenting with a tumefactive brain lesion on treatment with IFN-\u03b2.

Under this treatment, the patient showed persisting relapse activity and finally presented with a severe episode of subacute aphasia and right-sided hemiparesis due to a large T2 hyperintensive tumefactive lesion of the left brain hemisphere and a smaller T2 lesion on the right side. Despite rituximab therapy two further LETM episodes occurred, resulting in severe neurological deficits.

It could be unicentric or multicentric (MCD). Here, we describe a 27-year-old man with a prior history of AIDS, Kaposi sarcoma (KS), and latent syphilis who presented to the ED for persistent fatigue, fever, chills, night sweats, and productive cough. Infectious workup was negative, and the patient continued to have a high fever despite empiric antibiotic therapy. Bone marrow biopsy was performed and was negative for malignancy. The patient eventually underwent a left clavicular lymph node biopsy, which showed a plasma cell variant CD with positive immunostaining for human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8), and high HHV-8 viral load. We started the patient on rituximab and liposomal doxorubicin, but unfortunately, the patient had a severe anaphylactic reaction to the rituximab, so we could not proceed with this treatment. We, therefore, started tocilizumab treatment, which improved the patient\'s general condition, and he was eventually discharged from our hospital. Upon follow-up 11-months later, a repeat CT scan of the chest and abdomen showed a near-complete treatment response with decreased lymphadenopathy throughout and hepatosplenomegaly. IL-6 overproduction in patients with CD is linked to the production of inflammatory cytokines and has a role in tumor angiogenesis, which makes it potential for IL-6 targeted therapy. The diagnosis of CD, especially MCD, requires a high index of suspicion, and a lymph node biopsy is essential in the diagnosis. Tocilizumab, an IL-6 receptor antibody, could potentially be considered as a practical therapeutic approach in managing HHV-8 positive MCD patients who do not tolerate or respond to initial rituximab therapy.","IncludeStatus":"Exclude","LisedInColA":"No Label","originalFormulation":"No Label","AloneOrComb":"No Label","cancerType":"No Label","studyType":"No Label","therapeuticAssociation":"No Label"},{"id":"833","Drug":"Tocilizumab","PMID":"32314613","Title":"Factors Associated with Costs in Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-Cell Therapy for Patients with Relapsed/Refractory B-Cell Malignancies","Authors":"Zhu F, Wei G, Zhang M, Zhao H, Wu W, Yang L, Hu Y, Huang H.","Citation":"Cell Transplant. 2020 Jan-Dec;29:963689720919434. doi: 10.1177/0963689720919434.","CreatedDate":"4/22/20","Abstract":"Chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CAR-Ts) constitute a novel therapeutic strategy for relapsed/refractory B-cell malignancies.

To date, the clinical characteristics of COVID-19-infected cancer patients remain largely unknown. Patients and methods: In this retrospective cohort study, we included cancer patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from three designated hospitals in Wuhan, China. Clinical data were collected from medical records from 13 January 2020 to 26 February 2020. Univariate and multivariate analyses were carried out to assess the risk factors associated with severe events defined as a condition requiring admission to an intensive care unit, the use of mechanical ventilation, or death. Results: A total of 28 COVID-19-infected cancer patients were included; 17 (60.7%) patients were male. Median (interquartile range) age was 65.0 (56.0-70.0) years. Lung cancer was the most frequent cancer type (n = 7; 25.0%). Eight (28.6%) patients were suspected to have hospital-associated transmission. The following clinical features were shown in our cohort: fever (n = 23, 82.1%), dry cough (n = 22, 81%), and dyspnoea (n = 14, 50.0%), along with lymphopaenia (n = 23, 82.1%), high level of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (n = 23, 82.1%), anaemia (n = 21, 75.0%), and hypoproteinaemia (n = 25, 89.3%). The common chest computed tomography (CT) findings were ground-glass opacity (n = 21, 75.0%) and patchy consolidation (n = 13, 46.3%). A total of 15 (53.6%) patients had severe events and the mortality rate was 28.6%. If the last antitumour treatment was within 14 days, it significantly increased the risk of developing severe events [hazard ratio (HR) = 4.079, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.086-15.322, P = 0.037]. Furthermore, patchy consolidation on CT on admission was associated with a higher risk of developing severe events (HR = 5.438, 95% CI 1.498-19.748, P = 0.010). Conclusions: Cancer patients show deteriorating conditions and poor outcomes from the COVID-19 infection. It is recommended that cancer patients receiving antitumour treatments should have vigorous screening for COVID-19 infection and should avoid treatments causing immunosuppression or have their dosages decreased in case of COVID-19 coinfection.

Patients and Methods We performed a multicenter retrospective cohort study to evaluate association between survival outcomes and treatment extensions/delays of pembrolizumab-based regimens in advanced NSCLC patients. Those who had received at least four cycles in routine practice were divided into two groups: non-standard (Non-Std: \u22652 cycles at intervals >3weeks + 3days) and standard (Std: all cycles every 3 weeks or 1 cycle >3 weeks + 3 days). Results Among 150 patients, 92 (61%) were eligible for the study (Non-Std:27, Std:65). Reasons for patients with extensions/delays in the Non-Std group included: immune-related adverse events (irAEs,33%), non-irAE-related medical issues (26%), and patient-physician preference (41%). Non-Std group was more likely to have higher PD-L1 tumor proportion score, higher number of treatment cycles and pembrolizumab monotherapy. Univariate and 6-month landmark analyses showed longer median overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) in Non-Std group compared to the Std group. After multivariable adjustment for confounding factors, there was no significant difference in OS [HR 1.2 (95%C.I.: 0.3-4.8), p=0.824] or PFS [HR 2.6 (95%C.I.: 0.7-9.6), p=0.157] between the two groups.

Given the durability of benefit seen and the potential for cost reduction and decreased infusion frequency in these patients, this requires validation in prospective trials.","IncludeStatus":"Include","LisedInColA":"N/A","originalFormulation":"Yes","AloneOrComb":"Alone","cancerType":"Lung","studyType":"Clinical observational","therapeuticAssociation":"No effect"},{"id":"842","Drug":"Pre-print","PMID":"MedRxiv #","Title":"Dragon III- Phase 1: Feasibility and safety of neoadjuvant chemotherapy with fluorouracil plus leucovorin, oxaliplatin, and docetaxel (FLOT) for locally-advanced gastric cancer patients in China","Authors":"No Label","Citation":"No Label","CreatedDate":"No Label","Abstract":"Background: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy with fluorouracil plus leucovorin, oxaliplatin, and docetaxel (FLOT) has shown significant benefits for gastric cancer patients. However, it has not been well accepted in Asian countries, we conducted a prospective study on the safety and feasibility of this regimen in Chinese patients. Methods: This is an investigator-initiated, phase I, single-arm, open-label study. Patients with histology confirmed adenocarcinoma of the stomach or esophagogastric junction were enrolled. Patients received 4 cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) and4 cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy (AC) according to the FLOT regimen. Completion status of chemotherapy, adverse events, postoperative morbidities and pathological tumor regression were analyzed. Two years Overall survival (OS) and Relapse-free survival were presented. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT03646591. Results: Altogether 10 patients enrolled, all patients completed 4 cycles of the neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Among them, 8 patients received a full dose of the standard preoperative FLOT chemotherapy, the chemotherapy dose was reduced by 25 percent or less in 2 patients.All 10 patients underwent radical gastrectomy surgery. There was no anastomotic leak, reoperation and death due to surgical complications. Nine patients had R0 resection, 3 patients had complete or sub-total pathological tumor regression. Nine patients completed four cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy, but only one patient completed the full dose of adjuvant chemotherapy, The dose of adjuvant chemotherapy was reduced by 25% or less in other patients. There were no severe hematological adverse events (Grade 3or above), except a case with grade 3 anemia. Four patients had grade 3 or 4 vomitings, all other non-hematological adverse events were grade 2 or below. The median follow up time was 23.13 months, 8 patients achieved overall survival and 7 patients had relapse-free survival for this period. Two patients died of disease progression. Conclusions: The neoadjuvant chemotherapy with FLOT was well tolerated in Chinese patients. The completion rate was comparable with the previous result. Dose adjustment is necessary for adjuvant chemotherapy. The pathological regression and survival rate were comparable but the result needs reevaluation in a larger cohort.","IncludeStatus":"Include","LisedInColA":"N/A","originalFormulation":"Yes","AloneOrComb":"Combination","cancerType":"Esophagus/Stomach","studyType":"Clinical trial","therapeuticAssociation":"Effective"},{"id":"843","Drug":"Pre-print","PMID":"MedRxiv #","Title":"Cancer immunotherapy does not increase the risk of death by COVID-19 in melanoma patients","Authors":"No Label","Citation":"No Label","CreatedDate":"No Label","Abstract":"Background: Covid-19 pandemic by the new coronavirus SARS-Cov-2 has produced devastating effects on the health care system, affecting also cancer patient care. Data about COVID-19 infection in cancer patients are scarce, and they point out a higher risk of complications due to the viral infection in this population. Moreover, cancer treatments could increase viral complications, specially those treatments based on the use of immunotherapy with checkpoints antibodies. There are no clinical data about the safety of immune check point antibodies in cancer patients when they become infected by SARS-CoV-2. As checkpoint inhibitors, mainly anti PD-1 and anti CTLA-4 antibodies, are an effective treatment for most melanoma patients, avoiding their use during the pandemic could lead to a decrease in the chances of curing melanoma.

We report the characteristics and outcome of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 during breast cancer treatment at Institut Curie hospitals (ICH, Paris area, France). Methods: An IRB-approved prospective registry was set up at ICH on March 13th, 2020 for all breast cancer patients with COVID-19 symptoms or radiologic signs. Registered data included patient history, tumor characteristics and treatments, COVID-19 symptoms, radiological features and outcome. Data extraction was done on April 25th, 2020. COVID-19 patients were defined as those with either a positive RNA test or typical, newly appeared lung CT-scan abnormalities. Results: Among 15,600 patients actively treated for early or metastatic breast cancer during the last 4 months at ICH, 76 patients with suspected COVID-19 infection were included in the registry and followed. Fifty-nine of these patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 based on viral RNA testing (N=41) or typical radiologic signs: 37/59 (63%) COVID-19 patients were treated for metastatic breast cancer, and 13/59 (22%) of them were taking corticosteroids daily. Common clinical features mostly consisted of fever and/or cough, while ground-glass opacities were the most common radiologic sign at diagnosis. We found no association between prior radiation therapy fields or extent of radiation therapy sequelae and extent of COVID-19 lung lesions. Twenty-eight of these 59 patients (47%) were hospitalized and 6 (10%) were transferred to an intensive care unit. At the time of analysis, 45/59 (76%) patients were recovering or had been cured, 10/59 (17%) were still followed and 4/59 (7%) had died from COVID-19. All 4 patients who died had significant non-cancer comorbidities. In univariate analysis, hypertension and age (>70) were the two factors associated with a higher risk of intensive care unit admission and/or death. Conclusions: This prospective registry analysis suggests that the COVID-19 mortality rate in breast cancer patients depends more on comorbidities than prior radiation therapy or current anti-cancer treatment. Special attention must be paid to comorbidities when estimating the risk of severe COVID-19 in breast cancer patients.","IncludeStatus":"Exclude","LisedInColA":"N/A","originalFormulation":"No Label","AloneOrComb":"No Label","cancerType":"No Label","studyType":"No Label","therapeuticAssociation":"No Label"},{"id":"845","Drug":"Pre-print","PMID":"MedRxiv #","Title":"Systematic investigations of COVID-19 in 283 cancer patients","Authors":"No Label","Citation":"No Label","CreatedDate":"No Label","Abstract":"Background: Cancer patients are considered to be highly susceptible to viral infections, however, the comprehensive features of COVID-19 in these patients remained largely unknown. The present study aimed to assess the clinical characteristics and outcomes of COVID-19 in a large cohort of cancer patients. Design, Setting, and Participants: Data of consecutive cancer patients admitted to 33 designated hospitals for COVID-19 in Hubei province, China from December 17, 2019 to March 18, 2020 were retrospectively collected. The follow-up cutoff date was April 02, 2020. The clinical course and survival status of the cancer patients with COVID-19 were measured, and the potential risk factors of severe events and death were assessed through univariable and multivariable analyses. Results: A total of 283 laboratory confirmed COVID-19 patients (50% male; median age, 63.0 years [IQR, 55.0 to 70.0]) with more than 20 cancer types were included. The overall mortality rate was 18% (50/283), and the median hospitalization stay for the survivors was 26 days. Amongst all, 76 (27%) were former cancer patients with curative resections for over five years without recurrence. The current cancer patients exhibited worse outcomes versus former cancer patients (overall survival, HR=2.45, 95%CI 1.10 to 5.44, log-rank p=0.02; mortality rate, 21% vs 9%). Of the 207 current cancer patients, 95 (46%) have received recent anti-tumor treatment, and the highest mortality rate was observed in the patients receiving recent chemotherapy (33%), followed by surgery (26%), other anti-tumor treatments (19%), and no anti-tumor treatment (15%). In addition, a higher mortality rate was observed in patients with lymphohematopoietic malignancies (LHM) (53%, 9/17), and all seven LHM patients with recent chemotherapy died. Multivariable analysis indicated that LHM (p=0.001) was one of the independent factors associating with critical illness or death. Conclusions: This is the first systematic study comprehensively depicting COVID-19 in a large cancer cohort. Patients with tumors, especially LHM, may have poorer prognosis of COVID-19. Additional cares are warranted and non-emergency anti-tumor treatment should be cautiously used for these patients under the pandemic.","IncludeStatus":"Exclude","LisedInColA":"N/A","originalFormulation":"No Label","AloneOrComb":"No Label","cancerType":"No Label","studyType":"No Label","therapeuticAssociation":"No Label"},{"id":"846","Drug":"Pre-print","PMID":"MedRxiv #","Title":"Cancer and risk of COVID-19 through a general community survey","Authors":"No Label","Citation":"No Label","CreatedDate":"No Label","Abstract":"Background: Data are limited on the risk of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) among individuals with cancer and whether cancer-related therapy exacerbates this risk.

19 undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation at optical valley branch of tongji hospital affiliated with tongji medical college, huazhong university of science and technology, wuhan from february 12th to march 2nd, 2020. demographic, clinical, laboratory, and treatment data were collected and analyzed. all patients were followed until death or end of follow up (march 9th), and all survivors

Materials and methods A systematic search of PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central, Google Scholar, and MedRxiv was done for studies on cancer patients with COVID-19. Pooled proportions were calculated for categorical variables. Odds ratio and forest plots were constructed for both primary and secondary outcomes. The random-effects model was used to account for heterogeneity between studies. Results This systematic review of 31 studies and meta-analysis of 181,323 patients from 26 studies involving 23,736 cancer patients is the largest meta-analysis to the best of our knowledge assessing outcomes in cancer patients affected by COVID-19. Our meta-analysis shows that cancer patients with COVID-19 have a higher likelihood of death (odds ratio, OR 2.54), which was largely driven by mortality among patients in China. Cancer patients were more likely to be intubated, although ICU admission rates were not statistically significant. Among cancer subtypes, the mortality was highest in hematological malignancies (OR 2.43) followed by lung cancer (OR 1.8). There was no association between receipt of a particular type of oncologic therapy and mortality. Our study showed that cancer patients affected by COVID-19 are a decade older than the normal population and have a higher proportion of co-morbidities. There was insufficient data to assess the association of COVID-directed therapy and survival outcomes in cancer patients. Despite the heterogeneity of studies and inconsistencies in reported variables and outcomes, these data could guide clinical practice and oncologic care during this unprecedented global health pandemic. Conclusion Cancer patients with COVID-19 disease are at increased risk of mortality and morbidity. A more nuanced understanding of the interaction between cancer-directed therapies and COVID-19-directed therapies is needed. This will require uniform prospective recording of data, possibly in multi-institutional registry databases.","IncludeStatus":"Exclude","LisedInColA":"N/A","originalFormulation":"No Label","AloneOrComb":"No Label","cancerType":"No Label","studyType":"No Label","therapeuticAssociation":"No Label"},{"id":"853","Drug":"Pre-print","PMID":"MedRxiv #","Title":"A Multicentre Study of 2019 Novel Coronavirus Disease Outcomes of Cancer Patients in Wuhan, China","Authors":"No Label","Citation":"No Label","CreatedDate":"No Label","Abstract":"Background: At present, there is a global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia. Two previous case series from China have suggested that cancer patients are at a higher risk of COVID-19 pneumonia, but the reports were limited by small numbers and few clinical information. Objective: To study clinical characteristics and outcomes of cancer patients infected with COVID-19. Design: Retrospective study. Setting: Four designated COVID-16 hospitals in Wuhan, Hubei province, China. Participants: Medical records of 67 cancer patients admitted to hospitals between Jan 5, 2020 to Feb 18, 2020 were included. Measurements: Demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological and treatment data were collected. Survival data of the cohort was cut-off on Mar 10, 2020. Results: Of the 67 patients (median age: 66 years), the median age of patients who had severe illness was older than that of patients who had mild symptoms (P<0.001). Forty-three (64.2%) patients had other concurrent chronic diseases, and the proportion of severe patients had co-morbidities was higher than patients with mild disease (P=0.004). Twenty-three (34.3%) patients were still at the anticancer treatment phase, but no tumour progression and recurrence was observed for all the patients during the treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia. About 70% of these patients had fever (n=53, 79.1%) and/or cough (n=50, 74.6%). Lymphocytopenia was the main laboratory finding accompanying increased C-reactive protein and procalcitonin in cancer patients, especially in severe cases. By Mar 10, 2020, 18 (26.9%) patients died from COVID-19, and 39 (58.2%) patients have been discharged. The median age of survivors was younger than that of deaths (P=0.014). Lung cancer (n=15, 22.4%) with COVID-19 was the most common cancer type and accounted for the highest proportion COVID-19 resulted deaths (33.3%, 5/15). We observed a tendency that patients at the follow-up phase had a better prognosis than that at anticancer treatment phase (P=0.095). Limitation: This is a retrospective study with only 67 cases from four hospitals. And some specific clinical information was insufficient. Conclusion: This study showed COVID-19 patients with cancer seem to have a higher proportion of severe cases and poorer prognosis. The tendency of poor prognosis was more obvious in patients at anticancer treatment phase. We should pay more intensive attentions to cancer patients infected with COVID-19.","IncludeStatus":"Exclude","LisedInColA":"N/A","originalFormulation":"No Label","AloneOrComb":"No Label","cancerType":"No Label","studyType":"No Label","therapeuticAssociation":"No Label"},{"id":"854","Drug":"RCT-methylprednisolone","PMID":"29885994","Title":"Bevacizumab Monotherapy Reduces Radiation-induced Brain Necrosis in Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma Patients: A Randomized Controlled Trial.","Authors":"No Label","CreatedDate":"No Label","Abstract":"No Label","IncludeStatus":"Exclude","LisedInColA":"N/A","originalFormulation":"No Label","AloneOrComb":"No Label","cancerType":"No Label","studyType":"No Label","therapeuticAssociation":"No Label"},{"id":"855","Drug":"RCT-methylprednisolone","PMID":"1628373","Title":"Methylprednisolone as antiemetic treatment in breast-cancer patients receiving cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and 5-fluorouracil: a prospective, crossover, randomized blind study comparing two different dose schedules.","Authors":"No Label","Citation":"No Label","CreatedDate":"No Label","Abstract":"No Label","IncludeStatus":"Exclude","LisedInColA":"N/A","originalFormulation":"No Label","AloneOrComb":"No Label","cancerType":"No Label","studyType":"No Label","therapeuticAssociation":"No Label"},{"id":"856","Drug":"RCT-methylprednisolone","PMID":"1730278","Title":"Combination chemotherapy MOCCA in resistant and relapsing multiple myeloma.

Methods: Fifty-two patients who were candidates for curative colon resection were randomly assigned to laparoscopic or open surgery and, in a double-blind design, assigned to receive methylprednisolone (n = 26) or placebo (n = 26). Pulmonary function, postoperative pain, C-reactive protein, interleukins 6 and 8, and tumor necrosis factor alpha were analyzed, as was patient outcome.

Previous studies have suggested that azithromycin may reduce the incidence of post-lung transplant bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome. To evaluate if the early administration of azithromycin can improve airflow decline-free survival after allogeneic HSCT. The ALLOZITHRO parallel-group trial conducted in 19 French academic transplant centers and involving participants who were at least 16 years old, had undergone allogeneic HSCT for a hematological malignancy, and had available pretransplant pulmonary function test results. Enrollment was from February 2014 to August 2015 with follow-up through April 26, 2017. Patients were randomly assigned to receive 3 times a week either 250 mg of azithromycin (n\u2009=\u2009243) or placebo (n\u2009=\u2009237) for 2 years, starting at the time of the conditioning regimen. The primary efficacy end point was airflow decline-free survival at 2 years after randomization. Main secondary end points were overall survival and bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome at 2 years. Thirteen months after enrollment, the independent data and safety monitoring board detected an unanticipated imbalance across blinded groups in the number of hematological relapses, and the treatment was stopped December 26, 2016. Among 480 randomized participants, 465 (97%) were included in the modified intention-to-treat analysis (mean age, 52 [SD, 14] years; 75 women [35%]). At the time of data cutoff, 104 patients (22%; 54 azithromycin vs 50 placebo) had experienced an airflow decline; 138 patients (30%) died (78 azithromycin vs 60 placebo). Two-year airflow decline-free survival was 32.8% (95% CI, 25.9%-41.7%) with azithromycin and 41.3% (95% CI, 34.1%-50.1%) with placebo (unadjusted hazard ratio [HR], 1.3; 95% CI, 1.02-1.70; P\u2009=\u2009.03). Of the 22 patients (5%) who experienced bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome, 15 (6%) were in the azithromycin group and 7 (3%) in the placebo group (P\u2009=\u2009.08). The azithromycin group had increased mortality, with a 2-year survival of 56.6% (95% CI, 50.2%-63.7%) vs 70.1% (95% CI, 64.2%-76.5%) in the placebo group (unadjusted HR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.1-2.0; P\u2009=\u2009.02). In a post hoc analysis, the 2-year cumulative incidence of hematological relapse was 33.5% (95% CI, 27.3%-39.7%) with azithromycin vs 22.3% (95% CI, 16.4%-28.2%) with placebo (unadjusted cause-specific HR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.2-2.4; P\u2009=\u2009.002). Among patients undergoing allogeneic HSCT for hematological malignancy, early administration of azithromycin resulted in worse airflow decline-free survival than did placebo; these findings are limited by early trial termination.

Pharmacokinetic properties, however, require continuous daily intake over a prolonged period of time. As the macrolide azithromycin is characterized by a long half-life as well as potential antineoplastic activity in vitro, we have performed a phase II trial of long-term once-weekly oral azithromycin for treatment of MALT lymphoma. In a 2-stage-design, 16 patients (10 f/6 m) with histologically verified and measurable MALT lymphoma were included in the first phase of the trial, which could be expanded to a maximum of 46 patients depending on remissions in the first phase. Patients were given oral azithromycin 1500\xa0mg once-weekly 4 times a month, and restaging was performed after 3 and 6\xa0months. Two patients had gastric and 14 extragastric MALT lymphoma; 12/16 patients were treatment-naive and received azithromycin as first line treatment. Tolerance of this regimen was excellent, and 14/16 patients received 6\xa0months of treatment as scheduled, while 1 patient each discontinued after 4 (progressive disease) and 1 cycle (personal reasons), respectively. The most commonly observed side effects were mild nausea (n\xa0=\xa08) and diarrhea (n\xa0=\xa04). Efficacy, however, was low as only 4/16 patients (25%) responded, with 2 complete and 2 partial remissions, 9 patients (56%) had stable disease, and 3 patients 19%) were rated as progressive disease. As the predefined activity of more than 7/16 patients responding was not reached, the study was stopped after 16 patients. Although long-term once-weekly oral azithromycin showed some antilymphoma activity, the response rate was below the predefined threshold of interest. However, based on our data, one cannot rule out suboptimal dosing in our study; attempts to study azithromycin at a different mode of application might be warranted in the future.","IncludeStatus":"Include","LisedInColA":"Yes","originalFormulation":"Yes","AloneOrComb":"Alone","cancerType":"Lymphoid","studyType":"Clinical trial","therapeuticAssociation":"No effect"},{"id":"877","Drug":"Azithromycin","PMID":"24782093","Title":"Azithromycin enhances the favorable results of paclitaxel and cisplatin in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer","Authors":"Chu DJ, Yao DE, Zhuang YF, Hong Y, Zhu XC, Fang ZR, Yu J, Yu ZY.","Citation":"Genet Mol Res. 2014 Apr 14;13(2):2796-805. doi: 10.4238/2014.April.14.8.","CreatedDate":"5/1/14","Abstract":"Although new chemotherapeutic drugs have been applied constantly, their efficacy for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is still not satisfactory. In recent years, epidemiological investigations have shown that lung cancer may be induced by chronic Chlamydia pneumoniae (Cpn) infection, since stable high titers of Cpn antibodies, especially IgA, are a hallmark of chronic infections. Azithromycin is commonly used for the treatment of Cpn infections; however, there are only few reports regarding the application of azithromycin (A) combined with paclitaxel and cisplatin (TP) for advanced NSCLC. Considering that patients with NSCLC have a higher rate of Cpn infection, we proposed to employ azithromycin for Cpn infection in chemotherapy for advanced NSCLC. The aim of this study was to explore the effects of azithromycin on chemotherapy for NSCLC. A total of 86 patients with stage III-IV NSCLC were randomly divided into TP and ATP groups; the characteristics of patients in the two groups showed no significant differences. The TP group was treated with paclitaxel and cisplatin, and the ATP group was treated with azithromycin combined with TP for at least 4 weeks, followed by evaluation and comparison of efficacy, side effects and patients\' quality of life before and after chemotherapy between the two groups. Testing for Cpn infection revealed a significant difference in the case number before and after therapy in the ATP group (P < 0.01) compared with the TP group (P > 0.05), and a statistical difference was observed (P < 0.01) between the ATP and TP groups after treatment. The changes in quality of life of patients after two different chemotherapy regimens were statistically significant (P < 0.05), but there was a significant difference in only cognitive function after treatment. The changes in symptom scores of patients after the two different chemotherapy regimens were statistically significant (P < 0.05), but there was a significant difference in only shortness of breath and cough after treatment. Kaplan-Meier estimate was utilized to describe the survival function of patients in the two groups. The median survival time was 12.0 months for the TP group and 13.0 months for the ATP group. One-year survival rates of the TP and ATP groups were 45.0 and 75.0%, respectively, which were significantly different (P < 0.05). Our study of azithromycin+paclitaxe l+cisplatin on stage III-IV NSCLC patients achieved favorable results in terms of side effects and overall survival.

OPHTHALMOLOGICAL FINDINGS: The tumor was salmon-coloured, bulging and elastic and filled the whole lower conjunctival fornix of the left eye. There was no other pathological finding in the left eye. Uncorrected visual acuity was 20/20. Intraocular pressure was 12\u2009mmHg. The eye was fully motile. Incisional biopsy was performed in February 2007. The tumor was histologically an extranodal MALT lymphoma. DNA testing for Chlamydophila trachomatis and Chlamydophila pneumonia was negative. Systemic treatment was started with doxycycline (200\u2009mg daily). After six weeks, the tumour was slightly smaller. Azithromycin 500\u2009mg once a week was added. 18 months after initiation of the treatment, the tumour had completely regressed. A second sample taking in the former tumor area showed tumor-free conjunctiva and subconjunctival tissue. As a precaution, the combined antibiotic therapy was continued for 10 months and the patient was followed for five more years. The lymphoma did not relapse in the conjunctiva and orbit or in the whole body. We showed that extranodal MALT lymphomas of the conjunctiva can be successfully treated with antibiotics alone. At the start of therapy, the child was 13 years old. To our knowledge, this patient is the first child in Germany and one of the first in the world with ocular adnexal lymphoma who could be successfully treated with combined antibiotic therapy and who could be followed up for 5 years without relapse. Thus, we could avoid radiotherapy or chemotherapy in childhood and eliminate the risk of a therapy-induced secondary malignancy.","IncludeStatus":"Include","LisedInColA":"No","originalFormulation":"Yes","AloneOrComb":"Combination","cancerType":"Lymphoid","studyType":"Clinical case report","therapeuticAssociation":"Effective"},{"id":"879","Drug":"Azithromycin","PMID":"17062048","Title":"Do systemic antibiotics increase the survival of a full thickness graft on the nose?","Authors":"Kuijpers DI, Smeets NW, Lapi\u221a\xaere K, Thissen MR, Krekels GA, Neumann HA.","Citation":"J Eur Acad Dermatol Venereol. 2006 Nov;20(10):1296-301. doi: 10.1111/j.1468-3083.2006.01792.x.","CreatedDate":"10/26/06","Abstract":"Full thickness grafts on the nose do not always heal without problems.

Metformin, at a fivefold higher dose, displayed significant tumor growth inhibition in 3 of 12 PDXs similar to BPTES (2/8 PDXs) and DCA (2/6 PDXs). AOA and CQ had the lowest response rates. Gene set enrichment analysis conducted using the baseline gene expression profile of pancreatic tumors identified a gene expression signature that inversely correlated with phenformin sensitivity, which is in agreement with the phenformin gene expression signature of NIH Library of Integrated Network-based Cellular Signatures (LINCS). The PDXs that were more sensitive to phenformin showed a baseline reduction in amino acids and elevation in oxidized glutathione. There was no correlation between phenformin response and genetic alterations in <i>KRAS, TP53, SMAD4</i>, or <i>PTEN</i><b>Conclusions:</b> Phenformin treatment showed relatively higher antitumor efficacy against established PDAC tumors, compared with the efficacy of other metabolic inhibitors and metformin. Phenformin treatment significantly diminished PDAC tumor progression and prolonged tumor doubling time.

This was a single-institution trial of oral HCQ (200 or 400 mg twice daily) given for 14 days prior to planned surgery. Dose escalation was based on isotonic regression to model safety and biological effect based on plasma Par-4 analysis. Eight of the nine patients treated with HCQ showed elevation in plasma Par-4 levels over basal levels. No toxicities were observed with these dose regimens. The resected tumors from the eight HCQ-treated patients with elevated plasma Par-4 levels, but not the resected tumor from the patient who failed to induce plasma Par-4 levels, exhibited TUNEL-positivity indicative of apoptosis. Resected tumors from all nine HCQ-treated patients showed p62/sequestosome-1 induction indicative of autophagy-inhibition by HCQ. Our findings indicate that both dose levels of HCQ were well-tolerated and that Par-4 secretion but not induction of the autophagy-inhibition marker p62 correlated with apoptosis induction in patients\' tumors.","IncludeStatus":"Exclude","LisedInColA":"No Label","originalFormulation":"No Label","AloneOrComb":"No Label","cancerType":"No Label","studyType":"No Label","therapeuticAssociation":"No Label"},{"id":"883","Drug":"Chloroquine","PMID":"25412314","Title":"Combination simvastatin and metformin induces G1-phase cell cycle arrest and Ripk1- and Ripk3-dependent necrosis in C4-2B osseous metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer cells","Authors":"Babcook MA, Sramkoski RM, Fujioka H, Daneshgari F, Almasan A, Shukla S, Nanavaty RR, Gupta S.","Citation":"Cell Death Dis. 2014 Nov 20;5(11):e1536. doi: 10.1038/cddis.2014.500.","CreatedDate":"11/21/14","Abstract":"Castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) cells acquire resistance to chemotherapy and apoptosis, in part, due to enhanced aerobic glycolysis and biomass production, known as the Warburg effect. We previously demonstrated that combination simvastatin (SIM) and metformin (MET) ameliorates critical Warburg effect-related metabolic aberrations of C4-2B cells, synergistically and significantly decreases CRPC cell viability and metastatic properties, with minimal effect on normal prostate epithelial cells, and inhibits primary prostate tumor growth, metastasis, and biochemical failure in an orthotopic model of metastatic CRPC, more effectively than docetaxel chemotherapy. Several modes of cell death activated by individual treatment of SIM or MET have been reported; however, the cell death process induced by combination SIM and MET treatment in metastatic CRPC cells remains unknown. This must be determined prior to advancing combination SIM and MET to clinical trial for metastatic CRPC. Treatment of C4-2B cells with combination 4\u2009\u03bcM SIM and 2\u2009mM MET (SIM+MET) led to significant G1-phase cell cycle arrest and decrease in the percentage of DNA-replicating cells in the S-phase by 24\u2009h; arrest was sustained throughout the 96-h treatment. SIM+MET treatment led to enhanced autophagic flux in C4-2B cells by 72-96\u2009h, ascertained by increased LC3B-II (further enhanced with lysosomal inhibitor chloroquine) and reduced Sequestosome-1 protein expression, significantly increased percentage of acidic vesicular organelle-positive cells, and increased autophagic structure accumulation assessed by transmission electron microscopy. Chloroquine, however, could not rescue CRPC cell viability, eliminating autophagic cell death; rather, autophagy was upregulated by C4-2B cells in attempt to withstand chemotherapy. Instead, SIM+MET treatment led to Ripk1- and Ripk3-dependent necrosis by 48-96\u2009h, determined by propidium iodide-Annexin V flow cytometry, increase in Ripk1 and Ripk3 protein expression, necrosome formation, HMGB-1 extracellular release, and necrotic induction and viability rescue with necrostatin-1 and Ripk3-targeting siRNA. The necrosis-inducing capacity of SIM+MET may make these drugs a highly-effective treatment for apoptosis- and chemotherapy-resistant metastatic CRPC cells.

NVP-BEZ235 radiosensitized a variety of cancer cell lines, including SQ20B head and neck carcinoma cells and U251 glioblastoma cells. NVP-BEZ235 also increased in vivo radiation response in SQ20B xenografts. Knockdown of Akt1, p110\u03b1, or mTOR resulted in radiosensitization, but not to the same degree as with NVP-BEZ235. NVP-BEZ235 interfered with DNA damage repair after radiation as measured by the CometAssay and resolution of phosphorylated H2A histone family member X foci. NVP-BEZ235 abrogated the radiation-induced phosphorylation of both DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs) and ataxia telangiectasia mutated. Knockdown of either p110\u03b1 or mTOR failed to decrease the phosphorylation of DNA-PKcs, suggesting that the effect of the drug was direct rather than mediated via p110\u03b1 or mTOR. The treatment of cells with NVP-BEZ235 also promoted autophagy. To assess the importance of this process in radiosensitization, we used the autophagy inhibitors 3-methyladenine and chloroquine and found that either drug increased cell killing after NVP-BEZ235 treatment and radiation. Knocking down the essential autophagy proteins autophagy related 5 (ATG5) and beclin1 increased NVP-BEZ235-mediated radiosensitization. Furthermore, NVP-BEZ235 radiosensitized autophagy-deficient ATG5(-/-) fibroblasts to a greater extent than ATG5(+/+) cells. We conclude that NVP-BEZ235 radiosensitizes cells and induces autophagy by apparently distinct mechanisms. Inhibiting autophagy via pharmacologic or genetic means increases radiation killing after NVP-BEZ235 treatment; hence, autophagy seems to be cytoprotective in this situation. Our data offer a rationale for combining NVP-BEZ235 along with an autophagy inhibitor (i.e., chloroquine) and radiation in future clinical trials.","IncludeStatus":"No Label","LisedInColA":"No Label","originalFormulation":"No Label","AloneOrComb":"No Label","cancerType":"No Label","studyType":"No Label","therapeuticAssociation":"No Label"},{"id":"891","Drug":"Chloroquine","PMID":"25434381","Title":"Chloroquine enhances temozolomide cytotoxicity in malignant gliomas by blocking autophagy","Authors":"Golden EB, Cho HY, Jahanian A, Hofman FM, Louie SG, Sch\u221a\u2202nthal AH, Chen TC.","Citation":"Neurosurg Focus. 2014 Dec;37(6):E12. doi: 10.3171/2014.9.FOCUS14504.","CreatedDate":"12/2/14","Abstract":"In a recent clinical trial, patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme benefited from chloroquine (CQ) in combination with conventional therapy (resection, temozolomide [TMZ], and radiation therapy).

Using in vitro and in vivo experiments, the authors determined the mechanism by which CQ enhances TMZ cytotoxicity. They focused on the inhibition-of-autophagy mechanism of CQ by knockdown of the autophagy-associated proteins or treatment with autophagy inhibitors. This mechanism was tested using an in vivo model with subcutaneously implanted U87MG tumors from mice treated with CQ in combination with TMZ. Knockdown of the autophagy-associated proteins (GRP78 and Beclin) or treatment with the autophagy inhibitor, 3-methyl adenine (3-MA), blocked autophagosome formation and reduced CQ cytotoxicity, suggesting that autophagosome accumulation precedes CQ-induced cell death. In contrast, blocking autophagosome formation with knockdown of GRP78 or treatment with 3-MA enhanced TMZ cytotoxicity, suggesting that the autophagy pathway protects from TMZ-induced cytotoxicity. CQ in combination with TMZ significantly increased the amounts of LC3B-II (a marker for autophagosome levels), CHOP/GADD-153, and cleaved PARP (a marker for apoptosis) over those with untreated or individual drug-treated glioma cells. These molecular mechanisms seemed to take place in vivo as well. Subcutaneously implanted U87MG tumors from mice treated with CQ in combination with TMZ displayed higher levels of CHOP/GADD-153 than did untreated or individual drug-treated tumors.

Autophagy is a conserved self-digestion process that degrades cytoplasmic materials and recycles long-lived proteins and organelles within cells. In this study, we demonstrate that SAHA stimulates autophagy in Jurkat T-leukemia cells, which was evidenced by the appearance of autophagic vacuoles, formation of acidic vesicular organelles, recruitment of LC3-II to the autophagosomes and conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II . Moreover, SAHA treatment upregulated expression of Beclin 1 and Atg7 and promoted formation of the Atg12-Atg5 conjugate. Furthermore, inhibition of autophagy by chloroquine (CQ) enhanced SAHA-induced apoptosis. To determine the underlying mechanism of SAHA-induced autophagy, two complementary proteomic approaches (2-DE and SILAC), coupled with ESI-Q-TOF MS/MS analysis are utilized to profile differentially expressed proteins between control and SAHA-treated Jurkat T-leukemia cells. In total, 72 proteins were identified with significant alterations. Cluster analysis of the changed proteins reveal several groups of enzymes associated with energy metabolism, anti-oxidative stress and cellular redox control, which suggested an abnormal reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in SAHA-treated Jurkat T-leukemia cells. These observations were further confirmed by ROS chemiluminescence assay. Mechanistic studies revealed that SAHA-triggered autophagy was mediated by ROS production, which could be attenuated by N-acetyl cysteine (NAC), a ROS inhibitor. Finally, we illustrated that Akt-mTOR signaling, a major suppressive cascade of autophagy, was inactivated by SAHA treatment. Taken together, our study identifies autophagy as a reaction to counter increased ROS and is thus involved as a cellular prosurvival mechanism in response to SAHA treatment.","IncludeStatus":"No Label","LisedInColA":"No Label","originalFormulation":"No Label","AloneOrComb":"No Label","cancerType":"No Label","studyType":"No Label","therapeuticAssociation":"No Label"},{"id":"893","Drug":"Colchicine","PMID":"27093343","Title":"Efficacy Screening of Gloriosa Superba Extracts in a Murine Pancreatic Cancer Model Using (18)F-FDG PET/CT for Monitoring Treatment Response","Authors":"Capistrano R, Vangestel C, Wouters A, Dockx Y, Pauwels P, Stroobants S, Apers S, Lardon F, Pieters L, Staelens S.","Citation":"Cancer Biother Radiopharm. 2016 Apr;31(3):99-109. doi: 10.1089/cbr.2015.1954.","CreatedDate":"4/20/16","Abstract":"In vivo efficacy of two herbal extracts of Gloriosa superba L.

We conducted a phase 2 study (NCT00436852) in children and adolescents with progressive neuroblastoma to determine if ABT-751 prolonged the time to progression (TTP) compared to a hypothesized standard based on a historical control population. Children and adolescents (n = 91) with a median (range) age 7.7 (2.3-21.5) years and progressive neuroblastoma were enrolled and stratified by disease status into disease measureable by CT/MRI (n = 47) or disease assessable by (123) I-metaiodobenzylguanine scintigraphy (MIBG, n = 44). Response was evaluated using RECIST for measureable disease and the Curie score for MIBG-avid disease. ABT-751 was well tolerated. The objective response rate was 7%. The median TTP was 42 days (95% CI: 36, 56) in the measureable disease stratum and 45 days (95% CI: 42, 85) in the MIBG-avid disease stratum. TTP was similar to the historical control group (n = 136, median TTP 42 days). For the combined strata (n = 91), 1-year progression free survival (PFS) was 13 \xb1 4% and overall survival (OS) was 48 \xb1 5%. The low objective response rate and failure to prolong TTP indicate that ABT-751 is not sufficiently active to warrant further development for neuroblastoma. However, this trial demonstrates the utility of TTP as the primary endpoint in phase 2 trials in children and adolescents with neuroblastoma.","IncludeStatus":"No Label","LisedInColA":"No","originalFormulation":"No Label","AloneOrComb":"No Label","cancerType":"CNS/Brain","studyType":"No Label","therapeuticAssociation":"No Label"},{"id":"896","Drug":"Colchicine","PMID":"16166440","Title":"Phase 1 study of ABT-751, a novel microtubule inhibitor, in patients with refractory hematologic malignancies","Authors":"Yee KW, Hagey A, Verstovsek S, Cortes J, Garcia-Manero G, O\'Brien SM, Faderl S, Thomas D, Wierda W, Kornblau S, Ferrajoli A, Albitar M, McKeegan E, Grimm DR, Mueller T, Holley-Shanks RR, Sahelijo L, Gordon GB, Kantarjian HM, Giles FJ.","Citation":"Clin Cancer Res. 2005 Sep 15;11(18):6615-24. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-05-0650.","CreatedDate":"9/17/05","Abstract":"ABT-751 is an oral antimitotic agent that binds to the colchicine site on beta-tubulin.

ABT-751 is a novel sulfonamide antimitotic that binds to the colchicine site on beta-tubulin that leads to a block in the cell cycle at the G2M phase, resulting in cellular apoptosis. ABT-751 was investigated in this phase 1 trial designed to assess its maximum tolerated dose (MTD), dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), tolerability, and pharmacokinetics. ABT-751 was administered on a daily (q.d.) or twice daily (b.i.d.) oral schedule for 7 days every 3 weeks to 39 patients with refractory solid tumors. Toxicity was monitored weekly. Plasma and urine ABT-751 and metabolite pharmacokinetics were determined. The MTD for the q.d. schedule was 250 mg/d. DLTs during cycle 1 were abdominal pain, constipation, and fatigue. The MTD on the b.i.d. schedule was 150 mg. Cycle 1 of therapy with the 175 mg b.i.d. schedule was tolerated without DLT. However, six of seven patients reported grade 3 toxicity (ileus, constipation, abdominal pain, or fatigue), which occurred in cycle 2 or 3. ABT-751 was absorbed after oral administration with an overall mean T(max) of about 2 hours. The pharmacokinetics of ABT-751 were dose-proportional and time-independent. There was minimal accumulation of ABT-751 after multiple q.d. and b.i.d. doses. Efficacious concentrations, as determined from preclinical models (0.5-1.5 microg/mL), were achieved in all subjects. ABT-751 metabolism occurred primarily by glucuronidation and sulfation. No complete or partial tumor responses were noted, but one patient had a minor response, and four patients had stable disease lasting at least 6 months. The MTD and recommended phase 2 doses for ABT-751 were 250 mg q.d. and 150 mg b.i.d. on a 7-day schedule given every 3 weeks, due to subsequent cycle toxicities at 175 mg b.i.d. dosing.

In this study, 2\'-fluoro-6,7-methylenedioxy-2-phenyl-4-quinolone (CHM-1), a synthetic 6,7-substituted 2-phenyl-4-quinolone, was identified as a potent and selective antitumor agent in human hepatocellular carcinoma. CHM-1 induced growth inhibition of HA22T, Hep3B, and HepG2 cells in a concentration-dependent manner but did not obviously impair the viability of normal cells at the IC(50) for liver cancer cells. CHM-1-induced apoptosis was also characterized by immunofluorescence microscopy. CHM-1 interacted with tubulin at the colchicine-binding site, markedly inhibited tubulin polymerization both in vitro and in vivo, and disrupted microtubule organization. CHM-1 caused cell cycle arrest at G(2)-M phase by activating Cdc2/cyclin B1 complex activity. CHM-1-induced cell death, activation of Cdc2 kinase activity, and elevation of MPM2 phosphoepitopes were profoundly attenuated by roscovitine, a specific cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor. CHM-1 did not modulate the caspase cascade, and the pan-caspase-inhibitor z-VAD-fmk did not abolish CHM-1-induced cell death. However, CHM-1 induced the translocation of apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) from mitochondria to the nucleus. Small interfering RNA targeting of AIF substantially attenuated CHM-1-induced AIF translocation. Importantly, CHM-1 inhibited tumor growth and prolonged the lifespan in mice inoculated with HA22T cells. In conclusion, we show that CHM-1 exhibits a novel antimitotic antitumor activity against human hepatocellular carcinoma both in vitro and in vivo via a caspase-independent pathway. CHM-1 is a promising chemotherapeutic agent worthy of further development into a clinical trial candidate for treating cancer, especially hepatocellular carcinoma.","IncludeStatus":"No Label","LisedInColA":"No","originalFormulation":"No Label","AloneOrComb":"No Label","cancerType":"Liver","studyType":"No Label","therapeuticAssociation":"No Label"},{"id":"900","Drug":"Colchicine","PMID":"9387046","Title":"A phase I trial and pharmacokinetic evaluation of CI-980 in patients with advanced solid tumors","Authors":"Sklarin NT, Lathia CD, Benson L, Grove WR, Thomas S, Roca J, Einzig AI, Wiernik PH.","Citation":"Invest New Drugs. 1997;15(3):235-46. doi: 10.1023/a:1005854510468.","CreatedDate":"1/1/97","Abstract":"CI-980 is a synthetic mitotic inhibitor that binds to the colchicine binding site of tubulin.

To determine whether HCQ improves overall survival at 1 year in combination with gemcitabine hydrochloride and nab-paclitaxel (GA) among patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer. Open-label, phase 2 randomized clinical trial conducted between March 18, 2013, and November 16, 2017, at the University of Pennsylvania, HonorHealth, and The Johns Hopkins University among 112 patients with previously untreated metastatic or advanced pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1, and adequate marrow and organ function. All efficacy analyses were performed for the intention-to-treat population. Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive GA with or without HCQ. All patients received standard doses of GA, and those randomized to receive HCQ were treated continuously with 600 mg orally twice daily. Overall survival at 1 year. A total of 112 patients (45 women and 67 men; median age, 65 years; range, 43-86 years) were enrolled; 55 were randomized to receive GA plus HCQ, and 57 to receive GA. Overall survival at 12 months was 41% (95% CI, 27%-53%) in the HCQ group and 49% (95% CI, 35%-61%) in the non-HCQ group. Median progression-free survival was 5.7 months (95% CI, 4.0-9.3 months) in the HCQ group and 6.4 months (95% CI, 4.5-7.6 months) in the non-HCQ group. Median overall survival was 11.1 months (95% CI, 9.0-14.2 months) in the HCQ group and 12.1 months (95% CI, 9.3-15.5 months) in the non-HCQ group. Overall response rate was 38.2% (n\u2009=\u200921) in the HCQ group and 21.1% (n\u2009=\u200912) in the non-HCQ group (P\u2009=\u2009.047). Treatment-related grade 3 or 4 adverse events that differed between the HCQ and non-HCQ groups were neutropenia (23 of 54 [42.6%] vs 12 of 53 [22.6%]), anemia (2 of 54 [3.7%] vs 9 of 53 [17.0%]), fatigue (4 of 54 [7.4%] vs 0), nausea (5 of 54 [9.3%] vs 0), peripheral neuropathy (7 of 54 [13.0%] vs 3 of 53 [5.7%]), visual changes (3 of 54 [5.6%] vs 0), and neuropsychiatric symptoms (3 of 54 [5.6%] vs 0). The addition of HCQ to block autophagy did not improve the primary end point of overall survival at 12 months. These data do not support the routine use of GA plus HCQ for metastatic pancreatic cancer in the absence of a biomarker.

A 3 + 3 phase I trial design followed by a noncomparative phase II study was conducted in GB patients after initial resection. Patients received HCQ (200 to 800 mg oral daily) with RT and concurrent and adjuvant TMZ. Quantitative electron microscopy and immunoblotting were used to assess changes in autophagic vacuoles (AVs) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Population pharmacokinetic (PK) modeling enabled PK-pharmacodynamic correlations. Sixteen phase I subjects were evaluable for dose-limiting toxicities. At 800 mg HCQ/d, 3/3 subjects experienced Grade 3 and 4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, 1 with sepsis. HCQ 600 mg/d was found to be the MTD in this combination. The phase II cohort (n = 76) had a median survival of 15.6 mos with survival rates at 12, 18, and 24 mo of 70%, 36%, and 25%. PK analysis indicated dose-proportional exposure for HCQ. Significant therapy-associated increases in AV and LC3-II were observed in PBMC and correlated with higher HCQ exposure. These data establish that autophagy inhibition is achievable with HCQ, but dose-limiting toxicity prevented escalation to higher doses of HCQ. At HCQ 600 mg/d, autophagy inhibition was not consistently achieved in patients treated with this regimen, and no significant improvement in overall survival was observed. Therefore, a definitive test of the role of autophagy inhibition in the adjuvant setting for glioma patients awaits the development of lower-toxicity compounds that can achieve more consistent inhibition of autophagy than HCQ.

It has been associated with multiple immune-related adverse effects, including cutaneous eruptions. We describe two patients with clinical and histological findings that were consistent with subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus (SCLE) after receiving PD-1 inhibitor therapy for metastatic lung cancer. We successfully treated our first patient with systemic and topical steroids, photoprotection and hydroxychloroquine. However, he subsequently developed dermatomyositis after continuing PD-1 inhibitor therapy. Our second patient presented with a protracted course of a cutaneous eruption in spite of discontinuation of anti-PD-1 therapy and treatment with systemic corticosteroids and infliximab. This patient\'s SCLE resolved after the addition of topical steroids and photoprotection and discontinuation of anti-tumour necrosis factor therapy. She and her oncology team decided to pursue non-PD-1 inhibitor treatment for lung cancer owing to a lack of tumour response. We add SCLE and dermatomyositis to the growing list of autoimmune complications of PD-1 blockade. Our cases raise a number of questions, particularly in relation to the viability of continuing anti-PD-1 therapy after developing SCLE and the role of immunosuppressive therapy in patients with PD-1 inhibitor-associated connective tissue disease. What\'s already known about this topic? Programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) blockade, which is rapidly emerging as a therapy for a wide variety of metastatic malignancies, has been associated with multiple immune-related adverse effects. These include systemic autoimmune diseases such as colitis and thyroiditis in addition to numerous cutaneous adverse events. Cutaneous side-effects of PD-1 inhibitors most commonly reported in clinical trials include lichenoid reactions, eczematous dermatitis and vitiligo. What does this study add? We report two cases of PD-1 inhibitor-associated subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus (SCLE), with one patient progressing to dermatomyositis with continued PD-1 inhibitor treatment. In addition to being a novel cutaneous adverse event, we also demonstrate the possibility of development of multiple autoimmune diseases in one patient, which is different from classic drug-related SCLE. We discuss the treatment challenges for patients with autoimmune skin disease receiving PD-1 inhibitor therapy.","IncludeStatus":"No Label","LisedInColA":"No Label","originalFormulation":"No Label","AloneOrComb":"No Label","cancerType":"No Label","studyType":"No Label","therapeuticAssociation":"No Label"},{"id":"909","Drug":"Hydroxychloroquine","PMID":"27463016","Title":"Vorinostat and hydroxychloroquine improve immunity and inhibit autophagy in metastatic colorectal cancer","Authors":"Patel S, Hurez V, Nawrocki ST, Goros M, Michalek J, Sarantopoulos J, Curiel T, Mahalingam D.","Citation":"Oncotarget. 2016 Sep 13;7(37):59087-59097. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.10824.","CreatedDate":"7/28/16","Abstract":"Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) enhances the anti-cancer activity of the histone deacetylase inhibitor, vorinostat (VOR), in pre-clinical models and early phase clinical studies of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC).

There is growing evidence that autophagy inhibition could lead to improved anti-cancer immunity. To date, effects of autophagy on immunity have not been reported in cancer patients. To address this, we expanded an ongoing clinical study to include patients with advanced, refractory mCRC to evaluate further the clinical efficacy and immune effects of VOR plus HCQ. Refractory mCRC patients received VOR 400 milligrams orally with HCQ 600 milligrams orally daily, in a 3-week cycle. The primary endpoint was median progression-free survival (mPFS). Secondary endpoints include median overall survival (mOS), adverse events (AE), pharmacodynamic of inhibition of autophagy in primary tumors, immune cell analyses, and cytokine levels. Twenty patients were enrolled (19 evaluable for survival) with a mPFS of 2.8 months and mOS of 6.7 months. Treatment-related grade 3-4 AEs occurred in 8 patients (40%), with fatigue, nausea/vomiting, and anemia being the most common. Treatment significantly reduced CD4+CD25hiFoxp3+ regulatory and PD-1+ (exhausted) CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and decreased CD45RO-CD62L+ (naive) T cells, consistent with improved anti-tumor immunity.

Clinical trials in canine patients are conducted in the same way as in human patients, thus, to determine a maximum dose of HCQ that can be combined with a standard chemotherapy, a Phase I, single arm, dose escalation trial was conducted in dogs with spontaneous NHL presenting as patients to an academic, tertiary-care veterinary teaching hospital.

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells and biopsies were collected before and 3 d after HCQ treatment and assessed for autophagy inhibition and HCQ concentration. A total of 30 patients were enrolled in the trial. HCQ alone was well tolerated with only mild lethargy and gastrointestinal-related adverse events. The overall response rate (ORR) for dogs with lymphoma was 93.3%, with median progression-free interval (PFI) of 5 mo. Pharmacokinetic analysis revealed a 100-fold increase in HCQ in tumors compared with plasma. There was a trend that supported therapy-induced increase in LC3-II (the cleaved and lipidated form of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3/LC3, which serves as a maker for autophagosomes) and SQSTM1/p62 (sequestosome 1) after treatment.

We conducted a phase I trial combining bortezomib and hydroxychloroquine for relapsed or refractory myeloma. We enrolled 25 patients, including 11 (44%) refractory to prior bortezomib.

Electron micrographs of bone marrow plasma cells collected at baseline, after a hydroxychloroquine run-in, and after combined therapy showed therapy-associated increases in autophagic vacuoles, consistent with the combined effects of increased trafficking of misfolded proteins to autophagic vacuoles and inhibition of their degradative capacity. Combined targeting of proteasomal and autophagic protein degradation using bortezomib and hydroxychloroquine is therefore feasible and a potentially useful strategy for improving outcomes in myeloma therapy.

These results were compared with autophagy measurements in aggressive and indolent melanoma cells grown in two- and three-dimensional (3D) culture and as xenograft tumors. The effects of autophagy inhibition with either hydroxychloroquine or inducible shRNA (short hairpin RNA) against the autophagy gene ATG5 were assessed in three-dimensional spheroids. Patients whose tumors had a high autophagic index were less likely to respond to treatment and had a shorter survival compared with those with a low autophagic index. Differences in autophagy were less evident in aggressive and indolent melanoma cells grown in monolayer culture. In contrast, autophagy was increased in aggressive compared with indolent melanoma xenograft tumors. This difference was recapitulated when aggressive and indolent melanoma cells were grown as spheroids. Autophagy inhibition with either hydroxychloroquine or inducible shRNA against ATG5 resulted in cell death in aggressive melanoma spheroids, and significantly augmented temozolomide-induced cell death.

Cytotoxicity, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and unfolded protein response (UPR) activation of proteasome inhibitors, HIV-PIs, and their combination were assessed in three cell lines and primary cells derived from three ccRCC tumours by MTS assay, flow cytometry, quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and western blot, respectively. Proteasome activity was determined by activity based probes. Flow cytometry was used to assess apoptosis by annexin V/propidium iodide assay and ATP-binding cassette sub-family B member 1 (ABCB1) activity by MitoTracker\u2122 Green FM efflux assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA). Lopinavir and nelfinavir significantly increased the cytotoxic effect of carfilzomib in all cell lines and primary cells. ABCB1 efflux pump inhibition, induction of ROS production, and UPR pre-activation by lopinavir were identified as underlying mechanisms of this strong synergistic effect. Combined treatment led to unresolved protein stress, increased activation of pro-apoptotic UPR pathway, and a significant increase in apoptosis. The combination of the proteasome inhibitor carfilzomib and the HIV-PIs lopinavir and nelfinavir has a strong synergistic cytotoxic activity against ccRCCin vitro at therapeutically relevant drug concentrations. This effect is most likely explained by synergistic UPR triggering and ABCB1-modulation caused by HIV-PIs. Our findings suggest that combined treatment of second-generation proteasome inhibitors and HIV-PIs should be investigated in patients with metastatic RCC within a clinical trial.","IncludeStatus":"No Label","LisedInColA":"Yes","originalFormulation":"No Label","AloneOrComb":"No Label","cancerType":"Kidney","studyType":"No Label","therapeuticAssociation":"No Label"},{"id":"922","Drug":"Lopinavir","PMID":"20683757","Title":"Phase II trial of ritonavir/lopinavir in patients with progressive or recurrent high-grade gliomas","Authors":"Ahluwalia MS, Patton C, Stevens G, Tekautz T, Angelov L, Vogelbaum MA, Weil RJ, Chao S, Elson P, Suh JH, Barnett GH, Peereboom DM.","Citation":"J Neurooncol. 2011 Apr;102(2):317-21. doi: 10.1007/s11060-010-0325-3.

Strong CYP3A4 inhibition by ritonavir may contribute to the observed sorafenib toxicity.Alternate antiretroviral agents without predicted interactions are preferred for co-administration in patients with HIV and cancers for which sorafenib is indicated. We conducted a phase Ib study of sorafenib, a vascular epithelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR), c-kit, and platelet derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR)-targeted treatment in Kaposi sarcoma (KS). We evaluated drug-drug interactions between sorafenib and ritonavir, an HIV medication with strong CYP3A4 inhibitory activity. Two cohorts were enrolled: HIV-related KS on ritonavir (Cohort R) and HIV-related or classical KS not receiving ritonavir (Cohort NR). Sorafenib dose level 1 in cohort R (R1) was 200 mg daily and 200 mg every 12 hours in cohort NR (NR1). Steady-state pharmacokinetics were evaluated at cycle 1, day 8.

Therefore, 6 courses of carboplatin plus pemetrexed and 3 courses of gemcitabine followed by erlotinib were administrated, and therapy was changed to home medical care. The only drug-related adverse event was grade 1 neutropenia, and drug interaction between the simultaneously administered anti-retroviral and chemotherapeutic agents was not confirmed. The patient battled lung adenocarcinoma for 1 year after the diagnosis and died of cancer progression in October 2011. Her performance status was stable and the CD4 (+) lymphocyte count and HIV load were well controlled throughout the course of treatment. In conclusion, the agents used for this patient show high tolerability and can be used as an effective treatment strategy for lung cancer occurring in HIV-positive patients.","IncludeStatus":"No Label","LisedInColA":"No Label","originalFormulation":"No Label","AloneOrComb":"No Label","cancerType":"No Label","studyType":"No Label","therapeuticAssociation":"No Label"},{"id":"935","Drug":"Ritonavir ","PMID":"18333287","Title":"Progression of Kaposi sarcoma associated with iatrogenic Cushing syndrome in a person with HIV/AIDS","Authors":"Jinno S, Goshima C.","Citation":"AIDS Read. 2008 Feb;18(2):100-4.","CreatedDate":"3/12/08","Abstract":"This case report describes an exacerbation of AIDS-associated Kaposi sarcoma (KS) in the setting of iatrogenic Cushing syndrome caused by an interaction between ritonavir-boosted atazanavir and fluticasone.

These include cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurotoxicity. Although the IL-6R antagonist tocilizumab is approved for treatment of CRS, there is no approved treatment of neurotoxicity associated with CD19-targeted CAR-T (CART19) cell therapy. Recent data suggest that monocytes and macrophages contribute to the development of CRS and neurotoxicity after CAR-T cell therapy. Therefore, we investigated neutralizing granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) as a potential strategy to manage CART19 cell-associated toxicities. In this study, we show that GM-CSF neutralization with lenzilumab does not inhibit CART19 cell function in vitro or in vivo. Moreover, CART19 cell proliferation was enhanced and durable control of leukemic disease was maintained better in patient-derived xenografts after GM-CSF neutralization with lenzilumab. In a patient acute lymphoblastic leukemia xenograft model of CRS and neuroinflammation (NI), GM-CSF neutralization resulted in a reduction of myeloid and T cell infiltration in the central nervous system and a significant reduction in NI and prevention of CRS. Finally, we generated GM-CSF-deficient CART19 cells through CRISPR/Cas9 disruption of GM-CSF during CAR-T cell manufacturing. These GM-CSF<sup>k/o</sup> CAR-T cells maintained normal functions and had enhanced antitumor activity in vivo, as well as improved overall survival, compared with CART19 cells. Together, these studies illuminate a novel approach to abrogate NI and CRS through GM-CSF neutralization, which may potentially enhance CAR-T cell function.

In general, mild irAEs are treated with corticosteroids, while tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF\u03b1) inhibitors are reserved for refractory cases. However, prolonged use of TNF\u03b1 inhibitor (TNF\u03b1i) can induce widespread, significant immunosuppression, which can negatively impact the antitumour efficacy of ICI therapy. Therefore, in clinical scenarios where patients develop severe immunotherapy-induced irAEs, an unmet need exists for alternative therapeutic strategies that are effective and without immune dampening effects. The anti-interleukin (IL)-6 receptor antibody, tocilizumab, is a biological agent Food and Drug Administration approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and juvenile idiopathic arthritis. Here, we report on three patients who developed severe polyarthritis while receiving ICI therapy and were treated with tocilizumab.

Forty-two patients received either intravenous (IV) (NCT01385423) or subcutaneous (SC) (NCT02395822) recombinant human IL-15 (rhIL-15) after lymphodepleting chemotherapy and haploidentical NK cells. Escalating doses of rhIL-15 (0.3-1.0 \u03bcg/kg) were given on 12 consecutive days in a phase 1 trial. Of 26 patients, 36% had robust in vivo NK-cell expansion at day 14, and 32% achieved complete remission. Hypothesizing that SC dosing of rhIL-15 would be safer and better tolerated, 16 patients received 10 once per day doses of SC rhIL-15 at 2.0 \u03bcg/kg on a phase 2 trial. NK-cell expansion at day 14 was seen in 27% of the patients, and 40% achieved remission. rhIL-15 induced better rates of in vivo NK-cell expansion and remission compared with previous trials with IL-2, but it was associated with previously unreported cytokine release syndrome (CRS) after SC but not IV dosing.

The anti-leukemia effect of 1928zT2 T cells were determined by killing assays and in xenografts. Three patients diagnosed as relapse or refractory ALL with extramedullary involvement were infused with 1928zT2 T cells, and the clinical responses were evaluated by BM smear, B-ultrasonography, PET/CT, histology, flow cytometry, qPCR, ELISA, and luminex assay. 1928zT2 T cells exhibited enhanced effector function against CD19+ leukemic cells in vitro and in a xenograft model of human extramedullary leukemia. Notably, the 1928zT2 T cells eradicated extramedullary leukemia and induced complete remission in the three relapse and refractory ALL patients without serious adverse effects. 1928zT2 T cells expanded robustly in the circulation of these three patients and were detected in the cerebrospinal fluid of patient 3.

Despite this potential to alleviate cancer cachexia, tocilizumab has not been approved for this clinical use. Therefore, preceding our planned clinical trial of tocilizumab, we designed the two studies described here to evaluate the levels of IL-6 in patients with lung cancer and the effect of tocilizumab in a murine model of human cancer cachexia. First, we measured serum IL-6 levels in patients with lung cancer and analyzed its association with cachexia and survival. Next, we examined the effect of a rodent analog of tocilizumab (MR16-1) in the experimental cachexia model. Serum IL-6 levels were higher in patients with cachexia than those without cachexia. In patients with chemotherapy-resistant lung cancer, a high IL-6 serum level correlated strongly with survival, and the cut-off level for affecting their prognosis was 21 pg/mL. Meanwhile, transplantation of IL-6-expressing Lewis Lung Carcinoma cells caused cachexia in mice, which then received either MR16-1 or 0.9% saline. Tumor growth was similar in both groups; however, the MR16-1 group lost less weight, maintained better food and water intake and had milder cachectic features in blood.

Our clinical and experimental studies revealed that serum IL-6 is a surrogate marker for evaluating cachexia and the prognosis of patients with chemotherapy resistant metastatic lung cancer and that tocilizumab has the potential of improving prognosis and ameliorating the cachexia that so devastates their quality of life. This outcome greatly encourages our clinical trials to evaluate the safety and efficacy of tocilizumab treatment for patients with increased serum IL-6.","IncludeStatus":"No Label","LisedInColA":"No Label","originalFormulation":"No Label","AloneOrComb":"No Label","cancerType":"No Label","studyType":"No Label","therapeuticAssociation":"No Label"},{"id":"947","Drug":"Tocilizumab","PMID":"23138884","Title":"Nodular progression of lentigo malignant melanoma during a treatment with tocilizumab: cause or coincidence?","Authors":"Finet A, Amini-Adle M, Balme B, Colson F, Thomas L.","Citation":"Clin Rheumatol. 2013 Feb;32(2):277-80. doi: 10.1007/s10067-012-2114-1.

We describe here the case of a patient with severe RA, previously treated with prednisolone, methotrexate, leflunomide, etanercept, and rituximab, who, after 8 months of treatment with tocilizumab, developed rapidly progressive nodular melanoma on a preexisting pigmented lesion on her left cheek. Recently, another case of nodular melanoma under tocilizumab has been published. The possible causative role of tocilizumab and other immunomodulatory agents in the development of this malignancy is discussed. Based on the present case, dermatologic screening is recommended before initiation of tocilizumab.","IncludeStatus":"No Label","LisedInColA":"No Label","originalFormulation":"No Label","AloneOrComb":"No Label","cancerType":"No Label","studyType":"No Label","therapeuticAssociation":"No Label"},{"id":"948","Drug":"Tocilizumab","PMID":"30322878","Title":"Plasma Exchange Can Be an Alternative Therapeutic Modality for Severe Cytokine Release Syndrome after Chimeric Antigen Receptor-T Cell Infusion: A Case Report","Authors":"Xiao X, He X, Li Q, Zhang H, Meng J, Jiang Y, Deng Q, Zhao M.","Citation":"Clin Cancer Res. 2019 Jan 1;25(1):29-34. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-18-1379.

A 23-year-old male patient had been diagnosed with relapsed and refractory B-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia. The patient was recruited into our CAR-T clinical trial, and 1 \xd7 10<sup>6</sup>/kg of engineered anti-CD19 CAR-T cells was administered. After infusion of CAR-T cells (day 0), the patient underwent a typical CRS reaction, with increases in fever, muscle soreness, and inflammatory cytokines. He was treated with antiallergic and antipyretic drugs, glucocorticoids, and tocilizumab (4 mg/kg, days 3 and 5). However, CRS was not under control, and his condition rapidly deteriorated. He was transferred to the intensive care unit, where dexamethasone 10 mg q6h was administered, and plasma exchange was performed, with 3,000 mL of plasma replaced by fresh frozen plasma per day for 3 consecutive days. His symptoms gradually improved, and the CRS-related symptoms were relieved. Additionally, a bone marrow smear showed no lymphoblast cells, and minimal residual disease was negative on day 28. The patient was eventually discharged in a normal condition. CRS is caused by an exaggerated systemic immune response, potentially resulting in organ damage that can be fatal. Although therapeutic plasma exchange is not included in CRS management guidelines, this case shows that plasma exchange is feasible in at least some patients with severe CRS.","IncludeStatus":"No Label","LisedInColA":"No Label","originalFormulation":"No Label","AloneOrComb":"No Label","cancerType":"No Label","studyType":"No Label","therapeuticAssociation":"No Label"},{"id":"949","Drug":"Tocilizumab","PMID":"29932283","Title":"Therapeutic response of metastatic angiomatoid fibrous histiocytoma carrying EWSR1-CREB1 fusion to the interleukin-6 receptor antibody tocilizumab","Authors":"Potter SL, Quintanilla NM, Johnston DK, Naik-Mathuria B, Venkatramani R.","Citation":"Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2018 Oct;65(10):e27291. doi: 10.1002/pbc.27291.

We report a case of a patient with advanced melanoma and refractory Crohn\'s disease who was treated concurrently with pembrolizumab (anti-PD-1 antibody) and tocilizumab (anti-interluekin-6 receptor antibody). This novel treatment strategy was well tolerated and did not result in Crohn\'s disease exacerbation for at least 16\xa0weeks.

We correlated tisagenlecleucel cellular kinetics with clinical/product parameters in 111 patients treated in JULIET. Tisagenlecleucel persistence in responders and nonresponders, respectively, was demonstrated for 554 and 400 days maximum by flow cytometry and for 693 and 374 days maximum by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). No relationships were identified between cellular kinetics (qPCR) and product characteristics, intrinsic/extrinsic factors, dose, or immunogenicity. Most patients with 3-month response had detectable transgene at time of response and continued persistence for \u22656 months. Expansion (maximal expansion of transgene/CAR-positive T-cell levels in vivo postinfusion [Cmax]) was potentially associated with response duration but this did not reach statistical significance (hazard ratio for a twofold increase in Cmax, 0.79; 95% confidence interval, 0.61-1.01). Tisagenlecleucel expansion was associated with cytokine-release syndrome (CRS) severity and tocilizumab use; no relationships were observed with neurologic events. Transgene levels were associated with B-cell levels. Dose was associated with CRS severity, but this was not statistically significant after adjusting for baseline tumor burden. In contrast to the results from B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, similar exposure was observed in DLBCL in this study regardless of response and expansion was lower in DLBCL than B-ALL, likely from differences in cancer location and/or T-cell intrinsic factors. Relationships between expansion and CRS severity, and lack of relationships between dose and exposure, were similar between DLBCL and B-ALL. Tisagenlecleucel cellular kinetics in adult relapsed/refractory DLBCL improve current understanding of in vivo expansion and its relationships with safety/efficacy endpoints.

Efficacy and toxicity management of 19-28z CAR T cell therapy in B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Sci. Transl. Med. 6(224), 224ra25 (2014). Recently, chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell immunotherapy has entered clinical trials in patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. 19-28z CAR T cells express a fusion protein comprised of an anti-CD19 mAb fused with CD28 costimulatory and CD3-zeta-chain signaling domains. The current paper demonstrates that administration of 19-28z CAR T cells in patients with relapsed or refractory B-ALL in a Phase I clinical trial has led to 88% of patients undergoing complete remission. Despite the benefits, CAR T-cell therapy is associated with cytokine release syndrome toxicities. The authors demonstrated criteria to diagnose severe cytokine release syndrome (sCRS) and treated sCRS with either high-dose steroids or with tocilizumab, an IL-6 receptor-specific mAb. Although both alleviated sCRS, steroid treatment negated the beneficial effects of CAR T-cell therapy, whereas tocilizumab did not. Taken together, CAR T-cell immunotherapy can be used as a safe and effective approach against tumors with known tumor-associated antigens.","IncludeStatus":"No Label","LisedInColA":"No Label","originalFormulation":"No Label","AloneOrComb":"No Label","cancerType":"No Label","studyType":"No Label","therapeuticAssociation":"No Label"},{"id":"953","Drug":"Tocilizumab","PMID":"22286359","Title":"[Rheumatoid arthritis and multiple myeloma as comorbidity.
